However, in a comprehensive security evaluation process, the general consensus is that the STRIDE classification is only useful for threat elicitation, isolating threat modeling from the other security evaluation activities involved in a secure software development life cycle (SDLC). We present strideSEA, a STRIDE-centric Security Evaluation Approach that integrates STRIDE as the central classification scheme into the security activities of threat modeling, attack scenario analysis, risk analysis, and countermeasure recommendation that are conducted alongside software engineering activities in secure SDLCs. The application of strideSEA is demonstrated in a real-world online immunization system case study. Using STRIDE as a single unifying thread, we bind existing security evaluation approaches in the four security activities of strideSEA to analyze (1) threats using Microsoft threat modeling tool, (2) attack scenarios using attack trees, (3) systemic risk using NASA's defect detection and prevention (DDP) technique, and (4) recommend countermeasures based on their effectiveness in reducing the most critical risks using DDP. The results include a detailed quantitative assessment of the security of the online immunization system with a clear definition of the role and advantages of integrating STRIDE in the evaluation process. Overall, the unified approach in strideSEA enables a more structured security evaluation process, allowing easier identification and recommendation of countermeasures, thus supporting the security requirements and eliciting design considerations, informing the software development life cycle of future software-based information systems.",

This requires robust methods to quickly determine whether a file is malicious. Due to its speed and efficiency, static analysis is the first line of defense.\n  In this work, we illustrate how the practical state-of-the-art methods used by antivirus solutions may fail to detect evident malware traces. The reason is that they highly depend on very strict signatures where minor deviations prevent them from detecting shellcodes that otherwise would immediately be flagged as malicious. Thus, our findings illustrate that malware authors may drastically decrease the detections by converting the code base to less-used programming languages. To this end, we study the features that such programming languages introduce in executables and the practical issues that arise for practitioners to detect malicious activity.",

Recent advancements in hardware-isolated enclaves, notably Intel SGX, hold the promise to secure the internal state of machine learning applications even against compromised operating systems. However, we show that privileged software adversaries can exploit input-dependent memory access patterns in common neural network activation functions to extract secret weights and biases from an SGX enclave.\n  Our attack leverages the SGX-Step framework to obtain a noise-free, instruction-granular page-access trace. In a case study of an 11-input regression network using the Tensorflow Microlite library, we demonstrate complete recovery of all first-layer weights and biases, as well as partial recovery of parameters from deeper layers under specific conditions. Our novel attack technique requires only 20 queries per input per weight to obtain all first-layer weights and biases with an average absolute error of less than 1%, improving over prior model stealing attacks.\n  Additionally, a broader ecosystem analysis reveals the widespread use of activation functions with input-dependent memory access patterns in popular machine learning frameworks (either directly or via underlying math libraries).

To be effective, audio watermarks must resist removal attacks that distort signals to evade detection. While many schemes claim robustness, these claims are typically tested in isolation and against a limited set of attacks. A systematic evaluation against diverse removal attacks is lacking, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate whether recent watermarking schemes that claim robustness can withstand a broad range of removal attacks. First, we introduce a taxonomy covering 22 audio watermarking schemes. Next, we summarize their underlying technologies and potential vulnerabilities. We then present a large-scale empirical study to assess their robustness. To support this, we build an evaluation framework encompassing 22 types of removal attacks (109 configurations) including signal-level, physical-level, and AI-induced distortions. We reproduce 9 watermarking schemes using open-source code, identify 8 new highly effective attacks, and highlight 11 key findings that expose the fundamental limitations of these methods across 3 public datasets. Our results reveal that none of the surveyed schemes can withstand all tested distortions.

In the evaluation experiment, we used the DARPA TC Dateset, a large-scale public dataset, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the dependency explosion problem. In addition, we showed that about 6.8 to 39% of the activities in a computer system could be defined as patterns of benign activities. In addition, we showed that removing benign activities extracted from a portion of the log data (approximately 1.4% to 3.2% in size) can significantly reduce the search space (up to approximately 52%) in large data sets.",

We consider the problem of developing an effective and efficient fuzzer for the recently ratified QUIC network protocol to uncover security vulnerabilities. QUIC offers a unified transport layer for low latency, reliable transport streams that is inherently secure, ultimately representing a complex protocol design characterised by new features and capabilities for the Internet. Fuzzing a secure transport layer protocol is not trivial. The interactive, strict, rule-based, asynchronous nature of communications with a target, the stateful nature of interactions, security mechanisms to protect communications (such as integrity checks and encryption), and inherent overheads (such as target initialisation) challenge generic network protocol fuzzers. We discuss and address the challenges pertinent to fuzzing transport layer protocols (like QUIC), developing mechanisms that enable fast, effective fuzz testing of QUIC implementations to build a prototype grey-box mutation-based fuzzer; QUIC-Fuzz. We test 6, well-maintained server-side implementations, including from Google and Alibaba with QUIC-Fuzz. The results demonstrate the fuzzer is both highly effective and generalisable. Our testing uncovered 10 new security vulnerabilities, precipitating 2 CVE assignments thus far. In code coverage, QUIC-Fuzz outperforms other existing state-of-the-art network protocol fuzzers (Fuzztruction-Net, ChatAFL, and ALFNet) with up to an 84% increase in code coverage where QUIC-Fuzz outperformed statistically significantly across all targets and with a majority of bugs only discoverable by QUIC-Fuzz.

Provable security in steganography, a long-sought goal, has become feasible with deep generative models. However, existing methods face a critical trade-off between security and efficiency. This paper introduces SparSamp, an efficient provably secure steganography method based on sparse sampling. SparSamp embeds messages by combining them with pseudo-random numbers to obtain message-derived random numbers for sampling. It enhances extraction accuracy and embedding capacity by increasing the sampling intervals and making the sampling process sparse. SparSamp preserves the original probability distribution of the generative model, thus ensuring security. It introduces only $O(1)$ additional complexity per sampling step, enabling the fastest embedding speed without compromising generation speed. SparSamp is designed to be plug-and-play; message embedding can be achieved by simply replacing the sampling component of an existing generative model with SparSamp. We implemented SparSamp in text, image, and audio generation models. It can achieve embedding speeds of up to 755 bits/second with GPT-2, 5046 bits/second with DDPM, and 9,223 bits/second with WaveRNN.",

It is crucial not only to identify quantum vulnerable algorithms but also to detect vulnerabilities and incorrect crypto usages, to prioritize, report, monitor as well as remediate and modernize code bases. A U.S. government memorandum require agencies to begin their transition to PQC (Post Quantum Cryptograpy) by conducting a prioritized inventory of cryptographic systems including software and hardware systems.

By analyzing control and data flow the tool is able to build an extendable and querriable inventory of cryptography. Cryptoscope goes beyond identifying disconnected cryptographic APIs and instead provides the user with an inventory of cryptographic assets - containing comprehensive views of the cryptographic operations implemented. We show that for more than 92% of our test cases, these views include the cryptographic operation itself, APIs, as well as the related material such as keys, nonces, random sources etc. Lastly, building on top of this inventory, our tool is able to detect and report all the cryptographic related weaknesses and vulnerabilities (11 out of 15) in CamBench - achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

One of the functionalities that Fermilab experimenters rely on is the ability to automate batch job submission, which in turn depends on the ability to securely refresh and distribute the necessary credentials to experiment job submit points. Thus, with the transition to using tokens for grid operations, we needed to create a service that would obtain, refresh, and distribute tokens for experimenters' use. This service would avoid the need for experimenters to be experts in obtaining their own tokens and would better protect the most sensitive long-lived credentials. Further, the service needed to be widely scalable, as Fermilab hosts many experiments, each of which would need their own credentials. To address these issues, we created and deployed a Managed Tokens Service. The service is written in Go, taking advantage of that language's native concurrency primitives to easily be able to scale operations as we onboard experiments. The service uses as its first credentials a set of kerberos keytabs, stored on the same secure machine that the Managed Tokens service runs on. These kerberos credentials allow the service to use htgettoken via condor_vault_storer to store vault tokens in the HTCondor credential managers (credds) that run on the batch system scheduler machines (HTCondor schedds); as well as downloading a local, shorter-lived copy of the vault token.

Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which process diverse data types and enable interaction through various channels, have expanded beyond the text-to-text limitations of early LLMs, attracting significant and concurrent attention from both researchers and industry. While LLMs and LMMs are starting to spread widely, concerns about their privacy risks are increasing as well. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), techniques used to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model's training set, serve as a key metric for assessing the privacy vulnerabilities of machine learning models. Hu et al. show that various machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to MIA. Despite extensive studies on MIAs in traditional models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and implications in modern large-scale models like LLMs and LMMs. In this paper, we systematically reviewed recent studies of MIA against LLMs and LMMs. We analyzed and categorized each attack based on their methodology and scenario and discussed the limitations in existing research. Additionally, we examine privacy concerns associated with the fine-tuning process. Finally, we provided some suggestions for future research in this direction.",

However, most existing adversarial examples are generated on specific individual models, resulting in a lack of transferability. In real-world scenarios, attackers often cannot access detailed information about the target model, making query-based attacks unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a technique called Acoustic Representation Optimization that aligns adversarial perturbations with low-level acoustic characteristics derived from speech representation models. Rather than relying on model-specific, higher-layer abstractions, our approach leverages fundamental acoustic representations that remain consistent across diverse ASR architectures. By enforcing an acoustic representation loss to guide perturbations toward these robust, lower-level representations, we enhance the cross-model transferability of adversarial examples without degrading audio quality. Our method is plug-and-play and can be integrated with any existing attack methods. We evaluate our approach on three modern ASR models, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the transferability of adversarial examples generated by previous methods while preserving the audio quality.",

Proving that these compilation chains are secure is, however, challenging, and involves a non-trivial back-translation step: for any attack a target context mounts against the compiled program one has to exhibit a source context mounting the same attack against the source program. We describe a novel back-translation technique, which results in simpler proofs that can be more easily mechanized in a proof assistant. Given a finite set of finite trace prefixes, capturing the interaction recorded during an attack between a target context and the compiled program, we build a call-return tree that we back-translate into a source context producing the same trace prefixes. We use state in the generated source context to record the current location in the call-return tree. The back-translation is done in several small steps, each adding to the tree new information describing how the location should change depending on how the context regains control. To prove this back-translation correct we give semantics to every intermediate call-return tree language, using ghost state to store information and explicitly enforce execution invariants. We prove several small forward simulations, basically seeing the back-translation as a verified nanopass compiler. Thanks to this modular structure, we are able to mechanize this complex back-translation and its correctness proof in the Rocq prover without too much effort.",

With the surge of fuzzers and fuzzer platforms being developed such as AFL and OSSFuzz rises the necessity to benchmark these tools' performance. A common problem is that vulnerability benchmarks are based on bugs in old software releases. For this very reason, Magma introduced the notion of forward-porting to reintroduce vulnerable code in current software releases. While their results are promising, the state-of-the-art lacks an update on the maintainability of this approach over time. Indeed, adding the vulnerable code to a recent software version might either break its functionality or make the vulnerable code no longer reachable. We characterise the challenges with forward-porting by reassessing the portability of Magma's CVEs four years after its release and manually reintroducing the vulnerabilities in the current software versions. We find the straightforward process efficient for 17 of the 32 CVEs in our study. We further investigate why a trivial forward-porting process fails in the 15 other CVEs. This involves identifying the commits breaking the forward-porting process and reverting them in addition to the bug fix. While we manage to complete the process for nine of these CVEs, we provide an update on all 15 and explain the challenges we have been confronted with in this process. Thereby, we give the basis for future work towards a sustainable forward-ported fuzzing benchmark.",

The main idea comes with two requirements: First, a stateless decryption service is attached to the payment chain that allows decrypting messages with the decryption service operators secret key. Second, a \"Payment Contract\" is deployed on the payment chain that implements a function transferAndDecrypt(uint256 id, address from, address to, string keyEncryptedSuccess, string keyEncryptedFail) that processes the (trigger-based) payment, requests decryption, and emits the decrypted key depending on the success or failure of the transaction. The respective key can then trigger an associated transaction, e.g. claiming delivery by the buyer or re-claiming the locked asset by the seller. The stateless decryption service could be performed using a threshold description scheme, in which case the requirement of a single trusted entity would be removed.",

First, we provide counter-examples where severe privacy violations occur even if the privacy tests pass and instantiate accurate membership and attribute inference attacks with minimal cost. We then introduce ReconSyn, a reconstruction attack that generates multiple synthetic datasets that are considered private by the metrics but actually leak information unique to individual records. We show that ReconSyn recovers 78-100% of the outliers in the train data with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics.

Sandi can be seen as a reputation system that measures bad behavior, with strong integrity protections and resistance to manipulation. Unlike most reputation systems, Sandi is entirely based on ``downvotes'' and therefore requires strong privacy guarantees to prevent retaliation. It utilizes a ticket-based reporting mechanism to limit who can report. We also prove that Sandi incentivizes good behavior in a well-defined sense.\n  Sandi is by design unidirectional, so that message senders have Sandi scores and receivers can report them for inappropriate communication, but it is designed to benefit both senders and receivers. Senders benefit, as receivers are more likely to react to communication with the added trust signal. Receivers benefit from seeing senders' scores, allowing them to make more informed decisions about which senders to trust.\n  Receivers do not need registered accounts and neither senders nor receivers need long-term keys.

However, a size-security dilemma where every shard must be large enough to ensure its security constrains the efficacy of individual shards and the degree of sharding itself. Most existing sharding solutions therefore rely on either weakening the adversary or making stronger assumptions on network links.\n  This paper presents Arete, an optimally scalable blockchain sharding protocol designed to resolve the dilemma based on an observation that if individual shards can tolerate a higher fraction of (Byzantine) faults, we can securely create smaller shards in a larger quantity. The key idea of Arete, therefore, is to improve the security resilience/threshold of shards by dividing the blockchain's State Machine Replication (SMR) process itself. Similar to modern blockchains, Arete first decouples SMR in three steps: transaction dissemination, ordering, and execution. However, unlike other blockchains, for Arete, a single ordering shard performs the ordering task while multiple processing shards perform the dissemination and execution of blocks. As processing shards do not run consensus, each of those can tolerate up to half compromised nodes. Moreover, the SMR process in the ordering shard is lightweight as it only operates on the block digests. Second, Arete considers safety and liveness against Byzantine failures separately to improve the safety threshold further while tolerating temporary liveness violations in a controlled manner. Apart from the creation of more optimal-size shards, such a deconstructed SMR scheme also empowers us to devise a novel certify-order-execute architecture to fully parallelize transaction handling, thereby improving the performance of sharding systems. We implement Arete and evaluate it on a AWS environment by running up to 500 nodes, showing that Arete outperforms the state-of-the-art sharding protocols.",

Current approaches to LLM safety assessment, which employ datasets of templated prompts and benchmarking pipelines, fail to cover sufficiently large and diverse sets of jailbreak attacks, leading to the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. Recent research showed that novel jailbreak attacks could be derived by composition; however, a formal composable representation for jailbreak attacks, which, among other benefits, could enable the exploration of a large compositional space of jailbreak attacks through program synthesis methods, has not been previously proposed.

Drawing inspiration from that, this project introduces an innovative approach to USB side-channel attacks via congestion. We evaluated the susceptibility of USB devices and hubs to remote profiling and side-channel attacks, identified potential weaknesses within the USB standard, and highlighted the critical need for heightened security and privacy in USB technology. Our findings discover vulnerabilities within the USB standard, which are difficult to effectively mitigate and underscore the need for enhanced security measures to protect user privacy in an era increasingly dependent on USB-connected devices.",

While these services offer significant benefits, individuals want control over their data, transparency regarding how their data is used, and accountability from third parties for misuse. However, existing legal and technical mechanisms are inadequate for supporting these needs. A comprehensive approach to the modern privacy challenges of accountable third-party data sharing requires a closer alignment of technical system architecture and legal institutional design. In order to achieve this privacy alignment, we extend traditional security threat modeling and analysis to encompass a broader range of privacy notions than has been typically considered. In particular, we introduce the concept of covert-accountability, which addresses the risk from adversaries that may act dishonestly but nevertheless face potential identification and legal consequences. As a concrete instance of this design approach, we present the OTrace protocol, designed to provide traceable, accountable, consumer-control in third-party data sharing ecosystems. OTrace empowers consumers with the knowledge of who has their data, what it is being used for, what consent or other legal terms apply, and whom it is being shared with. By applying our alignment framework, we demonstrate that OTrace's technical affordances can provide more confident, scalable regulatory oversight when combined with complementary legal mechanisms.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2207.08486v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Adversarial attacks such as poisoning attacks have attracted the attention of many machine learning researchers. Traditionally, poisoning attacks attempt to inject adversarial training data in order to manipulate the trained model. In federated learning (FL), data poisoning attacks can be generalized to model poisoning attacks, which cannot be detected by simpler methods due to the lack of access to local training data by the detector. State-of-the-art poisoning attack detection methods for FL have various weaknesses, e.g., the number of attackers has to be known or not high enough, working with i.i.d. data only, and high computational complexity. To overcome above weaknesses, we propose a novel framework for detecting poisoning attacks in FL, which employs a reference model based on a public dataset and an auditor model to detect malicious updates. We implemented a detector based on the proposed framework and using a one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM), which reaches the lowest possible computational complexity O(K) where K is the number of clients. We evaluated our detector's performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) poisoning attacks for two typical applications of FL: electrocardiograph (ECG) classification and human activity recognition (HAR). Our experimental results validated the performance of our detector over other SOTA detection methods.",

In this paper, we propose the STATGRAPH, which is an effective and fine-grained intrusion detection methodology for IVN security services via multi-view statistical graph learning on in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) messages with insight into their variations in periodicity, payload and signal combinations. Specifically, STATGRAPH generates two statistical graphs, timing correlation graph (TCG) and coupling relationship graph (CRG), in every CAN message detection window, where edge attributes in TCGs represent temporal correlation between different message IDs while edge attributes in CRGs denote the neighbour relationship and contextual similarity. Besides, a lightweight shallow layered graph convolution network is trained based on graph property of TCGs and CRGs, which learns the universal laws of various patterns more effectively and further enhance the performance of detection. To address the problem of insufficient attack types in previous intrusion detection, we select two real in-vehicle CAN datasets covering five new instances of sophisticated and stealthy masquerade attacks that are never investigated before. Experimental result shows STATGRAPH improves both detection granularity and detection performance over state-of-the-art intrusion detection methods.

        "summary": "arXiv:2405.14517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The widespread usage of large-scale multimodal models like CLIP has heightened concerns about the leakage of PII. Existing methods for identity inference in CLIP models require querying the model with full PII, including textual descriptions of the person and corresponding images (e.g., the name and the face photo of the person). However, applying images may risk exposing personal information to target models, as the image might not have been previously encountered by the target model. Additionally, previous MIAs train shadow models to mimic the behaviors of the target model, which incurs high computational costs, especially for large CLIP models. To address these challenges, we propose a textual unimodal detector (TUNI) in CLIP models, a novel technique for identity inference that: 1) only utilizes text data to query the target model; and 2) eliminates the need for training shadow models. Extensive experiments of TUNI across various CLIP model architectures and datasets demonstrate its superior performance over baselines, albeit with only text data.",

To guarantee training data privacy and high-utility models, differential privacy and secure aggregation techniques are often combined with federated learning. However, with fine-grained protection granularities, e.g., with the common sample-level protection, the currently existing techniques generally require the parties to communicate for each local optimization step, if they want to fully benefit from the secure aggregation in terms of the resulting formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we show how a simple new analysis allows the parties to perform multiple local optimization steps while still benefiting from using secure aggregation. We show that our analysis enables higher utility models with guaranteed privacy protection under limited number of communication rounds.",

While leading corporations such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind have assessed GPT-o3-mini and Gemini on replication-related tasks and concluded that these systems pose a minimal risk regarding self-replication, our research presents novel findings. Following the same evaluation protocol, we demonstrate that 11 out of 32 existing AI systems under evaluation already possess the capability of self-replication. In hundreds of experimental trials, we observe a non-trivial number of successful self-replication trials across mainstream model families worldwide, even including those with as small as 14 billion parameters which can run on personal computers. Furthermore, we note the increase in self-replication capability when the model becomes more intelligent in general. Also, by analyzing the behavioral traces of diverse AI systems, we observe that existing AI systems already exhibit sufficient planning, problem-solving, and creative capabilities to accomplish complex agentic tasks including self-replication. More alarmingly, we observe successful cases where an AI system do self-exfiltration without explicit instructions, adapt to harsher computational environments without sufficient software or hardware supports, and plot effective strategies to survive against the shutdown command from the human beings. These novel findings offer a crucial time buffer for the international community to collaborate on establishing effective governance over the self-replication capabilities and behaviors of frontier AI systems, which could otherwise pose existential risks to the human society if not well-controlled.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2503.17514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: An important question today is whether a given text was used to train a large language model (LLM). A \\emph{completion} test is often employed: check if the LLM completes a sufficiently complex text. This, however, requires a ground-truth definition of membership; most commonly, it is defined as a member based on the $n$-gram overlap between the target text and any text in the dataset. In this work, we demonstrate that this $n$-gram based membership definition can be effectively gamed. We study scenarios where sequences are \\emph{non-members} for a given $n$ and we find that completion tests still succeed. We find many natural cases of this phenomenon by retraining LLMs from scratch after removing all training samples that were completed; these cases include exact duplicates, near-duplicates, and even short overlaps. They showcase that it is difficult to find a single viable choice of $n$ for membership definitions. Using these insights, we design adversarial datasets that can cause a given target sequence to be completed without containing it, for any reasonable choice of $n$. Our findings highlight the inadequacy of $n$-gram membership, suggesting membership definitions fail to account for auxiliary information available to the training algorithm.",
