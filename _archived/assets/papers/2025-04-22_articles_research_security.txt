This includes the RSA method, which uses Fermat's little theorem to support the creation and verification of a digital signature. The problem with a back-door is that the actual trap-door method could, in the end, be discovered. With the rise of PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography), we will see a range of methods that will not use trap doors and provide stronger proof of security. In this case, we use hash-based signatures (as used with SPHINCS+) and Fiat Shamir signatures using Zero Knowledge Proofs (as used with Dilithium).",

The emergence of diverse algorithms in recent years has introduced challenges in practical applications, such as inconsistent data processing methods, lack of in-depth algorithm analysis, and incomplete comparisons due to overlapping development timelines. These factors create significant obstacles to selecting appropriate algorithms.\n  In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a benchmark for evaluating tabular data synthesis methods. We present a unified evaluation framework that integrates data preprocessing, feature selection, and synthesis modules, facilitating fair and comprehensive comparisons. Our evaluation reveals that a significant utility-efficiency trade-off exists among current state-of-the-art methods. Some statistical methods are superior in synthesis utility, but their efficiency is not as good as most machine learning-based methods. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of each module with experimental validation, offering theoretical insights into the strengths and limitations of different strategies.",

DoomArena is designed on three principles: 1) It is a plug-in framework and integrates easily into realistic agentic frameworks like BrowserGym (for web agents) and $\\tau$-bench (for tool calling agents); 2) It is configurable and allows for detailed threat modeling, allowing configuration of specific components of the agentic framework being attackable, and specifying targets for the attacker; and 3) It is modular and decouples the development of attacks from details of the environment in which the agent is deployed, allowing for the same attacks to be applied across multiple environments. We illustrate several advantages of our framework, including the ability to adapt to new threat models and environments easily, the ability to easily combine several previously published attacks to enable comprehensive and fine-grained security testing, and the ability to analyze trade-offs between various vulnerabilities and performance. We apply DoomArena to state-of-the-art (SOTA) web and tool-calling agents and find a number of surprising results: 1) SOTA agents have varying levels of vulnerability to different threat models (malicious user vs malicious environment), and there is no Pareto dominant agent across all threat models; 2) When multiple attacks are applied to an agent, they often combine constructively; 3) Guardrail model-based defenses seem to fail, while defenses based on powerful SOTA LLMs work better.

To address this, the concept of stateless clients is under exploration, enabling validators to verify transactions using cryptographic witnesses rather than the full state. This paper compares two approaches currently being discussed for achieving statelessness: Verkle trees utilizing vector commitments and binary Merkle trees combined with SNARKs. Benchmarks are performed to evaluate proving time, witness size, and verification time. The results reveal that the Verkle tree implementation used for benchmarking offers proving and verification times on the order of seconds and proof sizes on the order of one MB. The SNARK-based Merkle trees exhibit slow proof generation times, while offering constant and fast verification time. Overall, the results indicate for Verkle trees to provide a more practical solution for Ethereum's stateless future, but both methods offer valuable insights into reducing the state burden on Ethereum nodes. We make the code used for benchmarking available on GitHub.",

Traditional security methods frequently struggle to detect previously unknown (zero-day) web attacks, putting sensitive user data at significant risk. Additionally, reducing human intervention in web security tasks can minimize errors and enhance reliability. This paper introduces an intelligent system designed to detect zero-day web attacks using a novel one-class ensemble method consisting of three distinct autoencoder architectures: LSTM autoencoder, GRU autoencoder, and stacked autoencoder. Our approach employs a novel tokenization strategy to convert normal web requests into structured numeric sequences, enabling the ensemble model to effectively identify anomalous activities by uniquely concatenating and compressing the latent representations from each autoencoder. The proposed method efficiently detects unknown web attacks while effectively addressing common limitations of previous methods, such as high memory consumption and excessive false positive rates. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ensemble, achieving remarkable detection metrics: 97.58% accuracy, 97.52% recall, 99.76% specificity, and 99.99% precision, with an exceptionally low false positive rate of 0.2%. These results underscore our method's significant potential in enhancing real-world web security through accurate and reliable detection of web-based attacks.",

By using eBPF to monitor file open events and running the backup process independently, the system avoids performance limitations when detection and protection contend for resources. We evaluated ROFBS$\\alpha$ against three ransomware strains, AvosLocker, Conti, and IceFire. The evaluation measured the number of files encrypted, the number of files successfully backed up, the ratio of backups to encrypted files, and the overall detection latency. The results show that ROFBS$\\alpha$ achieves high backup success rates and faster detection while adding minimal extra load to the system. However, defending against ransomware that encrypts files extremely quickly remains an open challenge that will require further enhancements.",

Recently, the European Union (EU) has started to consider also the relation between cyber security incidents and cyber security crises. These considerations and preparations, including those specified in the EU's new cyber security laws, constitute the paper's topic. According to an analysis of the laws and associated policy documents, (i) cyber security crises are equated in the EU to large-scale cyber security incidents that either exceed a handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states. For this and other purposes, (ii) the new laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents, including but not limited to the large-scale incidents. Despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them, however, (iii) the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear particularly at the EU-level. With these policy research results, the paper advances the domain of cyber security incident management research by elaborating how European law perceives cyber security crises and their relation to cyber security incidents, paving the way for many relevant further research topics with practical relevance, whether theoretical, conceptual, or empirical.",

However, \"first-hand\" data sources remain underutilized because it is difficult to access or scrape their data.\n  In this work, we analyze (i) 6.6 million posts, (ii) 3.4 million messages, and (iii) 120,000 darknet websites. We combine NLP tools to address several challenges in analyzing such data. First, even on dedicated platforms, only some content is CTI-relevant, requiring effective filtering. Second, \"first-hand\" data can be CTI-relevant from a technical or strategic viewpoint. We demonstrate how to organize content along this distinction. Third, we describe the topics discussed and how \"first-hand\" data sources differ from each other. According to our filtering, 20% of our sample is CTI-relevant. Most of the CTI-relevant data focuses on strategic rather than technical discussions. Credit card-related crime is the most prevalent topic on darknet websites. On underground forums and chat channels, account and subscription selling is discussed most. Topic diversity is higher on underground forums and chat channels than on darknet websites. Our analyses suggest that different platforms may be used for activities with varying complexity and risks for criminals.",

Anyone entering the mining game has to prove that they have expended a specific amount of computational power. However, the most popular Bitcoin blockchain consumes 175.87 TWh of electrical energy annually, and most of this energy is wasted on hash calculations, which serve no additional purpose. Several studies have explored re-purposing the wasted energy by replacing the hash function with meaningful computational problems that have practical applications. Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) in networks has numerous real-life applications. Building on this concept, Chrisimos [TrustCom '23] was proposed to replace hash-based PoW with the computation of a dominating set on real-life graph instances. However, Chrisimos has several drawbacks regarding efficiency and solution quality. This work presents a new framework for Useful PoW, ScaloWork, that decides the block proposer for the Bitcoin blockchain based on the solution for the dominating set problem. ScaloWork relies on the property of graph isomorphism and guarantees solution extractability. We also propose a distributed approach for calculating the dominating set, allowing miners to collaborate in a pool. This enables ScaloWork to handle larger graphs relevant to real-life applications, thereby enhancing scalability. Our framework also eliminates the problem of free-riders, ensuring fairness in the distribution of block rewards. We perform a detailed security analysis of our framework and prove our scheme as secure as hash-based PoW. We implement a prototype of our framework, and the results show that our system outperforms Chrisimos in all aspects.",

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial for securing IoT; however, traditional IDS often struggle to adapt to IoT networks' dynamic and evolving nature and threat patterns. A potential solution is using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance IDS adaptability, enabling them to learn from and react to their operational environment dynamically.

While there are many established algorithms for plaintext-plaintext matrix multiplication, efficiently computing plaintext-ciphertext (and ciphertext-ciphertext) matrix multiplication is an active area of research which has received a lot of attention. Recent literature have explored various techniques for privacy-preserving matrix multiplication using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes with ciphertext packing and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) processing. On the other hand, there hasn't been any attempt to speed up PC-MM using unpacked additively homomorphic encryption (AHE) schemes beyond the schoolbook method and Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. In this work, we propose an efficient PC-MM from unpacked AHE, which applies Cussen's compression-reconstruction algorithm for plaintext-plaintext matrix multiplication in the encrypted setting. We experimentally validate our proposed technique using a concrete instantiation with the additively homomorphic elliptic curve ElGamal encryption scheme and its software implementation on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge computing platform. Our proposed approach achieves up to an order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art for large matrices with relatively small element bit-widths.

A critical aspect of these examples is their transferability, allowing them to deceive {unseen} models in black-box scenarios. Despite the widespread exploration of defense methods, including those on transferability, they show limitations: inefficient deployment, ineffective defense, and degraded performance on clean images. In this work, we introduce a novel training paradigm aimed at enhancing robustness against transferable adversarial examples (TAEs) in a more efficient and effective way. We propose a model that exhibits random guessing behavior when presented with clean data $\\boldsymbol{x}$ as input, and generates accurate predictions when with triggered data $\\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. Importantly, the trigger $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ remains constant for all data instances. We refer to these models as \\textbf{models with trigger activation}.

This paper describes the shift from static credentials to OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation, and introduces SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone) as a runtime-issued, platform-neutral identity model for non-human actors. SPIFFE decouples identity from infrastructure, enabling strong, portable authentication across job runners and deployed workloads.

However, widespread adoption remains hindered by issues such as limited scalability, high transaction costs, and the complexity of maintaining coherent verification logic across different blockchain layers. This paper introduces Verifiable Applications (vApps), a novel development framework designed to streamline the creation and deployment of verifiable blockchain computing applications. vApps offer a unified Rust-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) within a comprehensive SDK, featuring modular abstractions for verification, proof generation, and inter-chain connectivity. This eases the developer's burden in securing diverse software components, allowing them to focus on application logic. The DSL also ensures that applications can automatically take advantage of specialized precompiles and hardware acceleration to achieve consistently high performance with minimal developer effort, as demonstrated by benchmark results for zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Experiments show that native Rust execution eliminates interpretation overhead, delivering up to an 832x cycle count improvement compared to EVM-based approaches. Precompiled circuits accelerate proving by over 95%, while GPU acceleration boosts throughput by up to 30x and recursion compresses proof size by up to 230x, enabling succinct and efficient verification. The framework also supports seamless integration with Web2 and Web3 systems, enabling developers to focus solely on their application logic. Through modular architecture, robust security guarantees, and composability, vApps pave the way toward a trust-minimized and verifiable Internet-scale application environment.",

Existing schemes either require expensive specialized equipment, rely on spyware, or are limited to close-range signal acquisition. In this paper, we propose a scheme, CSI2Dig, for recovering digit content from Channel State Information (CSI) when digits are played through a smartphone loudspeaker. We observe that the electromagnetic interference caused by the audio signals from the loudspeaker affects the WiFi signals emitted by the phone's WiFi antenna. Building upon contrastive learning and denoising autoencoders, we develop a two-branch autoencoder network designed to amplify the impact of this electromagnetic interference on CSI. For feature extraction, we introduce the TS-Net, a model that captures relevant features from both the temporal and spatial dimensions of the CSI data. We evaluate our scheme across various devices, distances, volumes, and other settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can achieve an accuracy of 72.97%.",

Peekaboo, a Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) tool, defeats malware evasion techniques to capture authentic behavior at the Assembly (ASM) instruction level. This behavior exhibits patterns consistent with Zipf's law, a distribution commonly seen in natural languages, making Transformer models particularly effective for binary classification tasks. We introduce Alpha, a framework for zero day malware detection that leverages Transformer models and ASM language. Alpha is trained on malware and benign software data collected through Peekaboo, enabling it to identify entirely new samples with exceptional accuracy. Alpha eliminates any common functions from the test samples that are in the training dataset. This forces the model to rely on contextual patterns and novel ASM instruction combinations to detect malicious behavior, rather than memorizing familiar features. By combining the strengths of DBI, ASM analysis, and Transformer architectures, Alpha offers a powerful approach to proactively addressing the evolving threat of malware. Alpha demonstrates perfect accuracy for Ransomware, Worms and APTs with flawless classification for both malicious and benign samples.

Despite their common goals, the principal L2 paradigms -- payment channels, rollups, and sidechains -- differ substantially in architecture and assumptions, making it difficult to comparatively analyze their security and trade-offs.\n  To address this, we present the first general security framework for L2 protocols. Our framework is based on the IITM-based Universal Composability (iUC) framework, in which L2 protocols are modeled as stateful machines interacting with higher-level protocol users and the underlying ledger. The methodology defines a generic execution environment that captures ledger events, message passing, and adversarial scheduling, and characterizes security through trace-based predicates parameterized by adversarial capabilities and timing assumptions. By abstracting away from protocol-specific details while preserving critical interface and execution behavior, the framework enables modular, protocol-agnostic reasoning and composable security proofs across a wide range of L2 constructions.\n  To demonstrate its applicability, we analyze an example from each of the three dominant L2 scaling paradigms: a payment channel (Brick), a sidechain (Liquid Network), and a rollup (Arbitrum). By instantiating each within our framework, we derive their security properties and expose trade-offs. These include the time for dispute resolution, distribution of off-chain storage and computation, and varying trust assumptions (e.g., reliance on honest parties or data availability). Our framework unifies the analysis of diverse L2 designs and pinpoints their strengths and limitations, providing a foundation for secure, systematic L2 development.",

However, the collection and analysis of user-generated stream data raise privacy concerns due to the potential exposure of sensitive information. To address these concerns, local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a promising standard. Nevertheless, applying LDP to stream data presents significant challenges, as stream data often involves a large or even infinite number of values. Allocating a given privacy budget across these data points would introduce overwhelming LDP noise to the original stream data.\n  Beyond existing approaches that merely use perturbed values for estimating statistics, our design leverages them for both perturbation and estimation. This dual utilization arises from a key observation: each user knows their own ground truth and perturbed values, enabling a precise computation of the deviation error caused by perturbation. By incorporating this deviation into the perturbation process of subsequent values, the previous noise can be calibrated. Following this insight, we introduce the Iterative Perturbation Parameterization (IPP) method, which utilizes current perturbed results to calibrate the subsequent perturbation process. To enhance the robustness of calibration and reduce sensitivity, two algorithms, namely Accumulated Perturbation Parameterization (APP) and Clipped Accumulated Perturbation Parameterization (CAPP) are further developed. We prove that these three algorithms satisfy $w$-event differential privacy while significantly improving utility. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques outperform state-of-the-art LDP stream publishing solutions in terms of utility, while retaining the same privacy guarantee.",

Although existing generative watermarking techniques have proposed corresponding solutions, most methods require substantial computational overhead and training costs. In addition, some methods have limitations in robustness when handling variable-length inputs. To tackle these challenges, we propose \\textsc{SOLIDO}, a novel generative watermarking method that integrates parameter-efficient fine-tuning with speech watermarking through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for speech diffusion models. Concretely, the watermark encoder converts the watermark to align with the input of diffusion models. To achieve precise watermark extraction from variable-length inputs, the watermark decoder based on depthwise separable convolution is designed for watermark recovery. To further enhance speech generation performance and watermark extraction capability, we propose a speech-driven lightweight fine-tuning strategy, which reduces computational overhead through LoRA. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method ensures high-fidelity watermarked speech even at a large capacity of 2000 bps. Furthermore, against common individual and compound speech attacks, our SOLIDO achieves a maximum average extraction accuracy of 99.20\\% and 98.43\\%, respectively.

The existing empirical research realizes the static analysis of smart contracts from the perspective of the lifecycle and gives the corresponding measures for each stage.

Concurrently, rapid advancements in image generation have made generated images viable as cover media. However, existing distortion design methods based on machine learning do not fully leverage the advantages of generated cover media, resulting in suboptimal security performance. To address this issue, we propose GIFDL (Generated Image Fluctuation Distortion Learning), a steganographic distortion learning method based on the fluctuations in generated images. Inspired by the idea of natural steganography, we take a series of highly similar fluctuation images as the input to the steganographic distortion generator and introduce a new GAN training strategy to disguise stego images as fluctuation images. Experimental results demonstrate that GIFDL, compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based distortion learning methods, exhibits superior resistance to steganalysis, increasing the detection error rates by an average of 3.30% across three steganalyzers.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.14368v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Differentially private (DP) machine learning often relies on the availability of public data for tasks like privacy-utility trade-off estimation, hyperparameter tuning, and pretraining. While public data assumptions may be reasonable in text and image domains, they are less likely to hold for tabular data due to tabular data heterogeneity across domains. We propose leveraging powerful priors to address this limitation; specifically, we synthesize realistic tabular data directly from schema-level specifications - such as variable names, types, and permissible ranges - without ever accessing sensitive records. To that end, this work introduces the notion of \"surrogate\" public data - datasets generated independently of sensitive data, which consume no privacy loss budget and are constructed solely from publicly available schema or metadata. Surrogate public data are intended to encode plausible statistical assumptions (informed by publicly available information) into a dataset with many downstream uses in private mechanisms. We automate the process of generating surrogate public data with large language models (LLMs); in particular, we propose two methods: direct record generation as CSV files, and automated structural causal model (SCM) construction for sampling records. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that surrogate public tabular data can effectively replace traditional public data when pretraining differentially private tabular classifiers. To a lesser extent, surrogate public data are also useful for hyperparameter tuning of DP synthetic data generators, and for estimating the privacy-utility tradeoff.",

With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.",

Deep learning-based methods can autonomously extract latent patterns from massive network traffic, demonstrating significant potential for IoT traffic classification tasks. However, the limited computational and spatial resources of IoT devices pose challenges for deploying more complex deep learning models. Existing methods rely heavily on either flow-level features or raw packet byte features. Flow-level features often require inspecting entire or most of the traffic flow, leading to excessive resource consumption, while raw packet byte features fail to distinguish between headers and payloads, overlooking semantic differences and introducing noise from feature misalignment. Therefore, this paper proposes IoT-AMLHP, an aligned multimodal learning framework for resource-efficient malicious IoT traffic classification. Firstly, the framework constructs a packet-wise header-payload representation by parsing packet headers and payload bytes, resulting in an aligned and standardized multimodal traffic representation that enhances the characterization of heterogeneous IoT traffic. Subsequently, the traffic representation is fed into a resource-efficient neural network comprising a multimodal feature extraction module and a multimodal fusion module. The extraction module employs efficient depthwise separable convolutions to capture multi-scale features from different modalities while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The fusion module adaptively captures complementary features from different modalities and effectively fuses multimodal features.",

Our results suggest that, just as randomness is fundamental to classical cryptography, quantum resources may play a similarly crucial role in the quantum setting.\n  Finally, we focus on the specific case of entanglement, analyzing different definitions of pseudoentanglement and their implications for constructing EPFI pairs.

However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.",

However, conventional ABFT approaches rely on rigorous verification mechanisms where even minor computational deviations trigger error recovery processes, which not only disregards the intrinsic fault tolerance characteristics of DNN models but also incurs redundant fault tolerance processing overhead. To address these limitations, we propose an Approximate ABFT framework (ApproxABFT) that innovatively introduces adaptive error tolerance thresholds to enable selective fault recovery, activating error correction modules exclusively when computational deviations exceed predefined thresholds. This approach effectively mitigating overreaction to non-critical computational errors. Furthermore, a dynamic block granularity optimization algorithm is implemented to achieve inter-layer error sensitivity balancing. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ApproxABFT achieves a 43.39% average reduction in redundant computing overhead compared to previous accurate ABFT, while simultaneously enhancing the tolerable soft error rate by an order of magnitude.",

To assess the security of a Honeyword system, two metrics--flatness and success-number--have been proposed and evaluated using various simulated attackers. Existing evaluations typically apply statistical learning methods to distinguish real passwords from decoys on real-world datasets. However, such evaluations may overestimate the system's security, as more effective distinguishing attacks could potentially exist.\n  In this paper, we aim to analyze the security of Honeyword systems under the strongest theoretical attack, rather than relying on specific, expert-crafted attacks evaluated in prior experimental studies. We first derive mathematical expressions for the flatness and success-number under the strongest attack. We conduct analyses and computations for several typical scenarios, and determine the security of honeyword generation methods using a uniform distribution and the List model as examples.\n  We further evaluate the security of existing honeyword generation methods based on password probability models (PPMs), which depends on the sample size used for training. We investigate, for the first time, the sample complexity of several representative PPMs, introducing two novel polynomial-time approximation schemes for computing the total variation between PCFG models and between higher-order Markov models. Our experimental results show that for small-scale password distributions, sample sizes on the order of millions--often tens of millions--are required to reduce the total variation below 0.1. A surprising result is that we establish an equivalence between flatness and total variation, thus bridging the theoretical study of Honeyword systems with classical information theory.

We formally prove the security of LightQSign in the random oracle model and evaluate its performance on commodity hardware and a resource-constrained 8-bit AtMega128A1 microcontroller. Experimental results show that LightQSign outperforms NIST PQC standards with lower computational overhead, minimal memory usage, and compact signatures.

However, their training process inadvertently leads to the memorization of sensitive information, posing severe privacy risks. Existing studies on memorization in LLMs primarily rely on prompt engineering techniques, which suffer from limitations such as widespread hallucination and inefficient extraction of the target sensitive information. In this paper, we present a novel approach to characterize real and fake secrets generated by Code LLMs based on token probabilities. We identify four key characteristics that differentiate genuine secrets from hallucinated ones, providing insights into distinguishing real and fake secrets. To overcome the limitations of existing works, we propose DESEC, a two-stage method that leverages token-level features derived from the identified characteristics to guide the token decoding process. DESEC consists of constructing an offline token scoring model using a proxy Code LLM and employing the scoring model to guide the decoding process by reassigning token likelihoods. Through extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art Code LLMs using a diverse dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance of DESEC in achieving a higher plausible rate and extracting more real secrets compared to existing baselines. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of our token-level approach in enabling an extensive assessment of the privacy leakage risks associated with Code LLMs.",

It makes the hiding capacity of GS higher than that of traditional steganography, as well as more resistant to classical steganalysis. However, the generators and extractors of existing GS methods can only target specific formats and types of data and lack of universality. Besides, the model size is usually related to the underlying grid resolution, and the transmission behavior of the extractor is susceptible to suspicion of steganalysis. Implicit neural representation(INR) is a technique for representing data in a continuous manner. Inspired by this, we propose an INR-based generative steganography by point cloud representation (INR-GSPC). By using the function generator, the problem of the generator model size growing exponentially with the increase of gridded data has been solved. That is able to generate a wide range of data types and break through the limitation of resolution. In order to unify the data formats of the generator and message extractor, the data is converted to point cloud representation. We designed and fixed a point cloud message extractor. By iterating over the point cloud with adding small perturbations to generate stego-media. This method can avoid the training and transmission process of the message extractor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to apply point cloud to generative steganography. Experiments demonstrate that the stego-images generated by the scheme have an average PSNR value of more than 65, and the accuracy of message extraction reaches more than 99%.",

We propose two attacks (black-box and white-box) based on the accessibility to LLMs and show that LLMs could connect the pair of DP-sanitized text and the corresponding private training data of LLMs by giving sample text pairs as instructions (in the black-box attacks) or fine-tuning data (in the white-box attacks). To illustrate our findings, we conduct comprehensive experiments on modern LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-4o, Claude-3, Claude-3.5, OPT, GPT-Neo, GPT-J, Gemma-2, and Pythia) using commonly used datasets (such as WikiMIA, Pile-CC, and Pile-Wiki) against both word-level and sentence-level DP.

However, current CTI knowledge extraction methods lack flexibility and generalizability, often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete knowledge extraction. Syntax parsing relies on fixed rules and dictionaries, while model fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets, making both paradigms challenging to adapt to new threats and ontologies. To bridge the gap, we propose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge extraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction. Unlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter tuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples. This is achieved through: (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt construction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a wide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity alignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes redundancy; (3) an long-distance relation prediction technique to further complete the CSKG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150 real-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and complete CSKG, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an efficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.",

Furthermore, we design a new system for storing and trading vehicle information based on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contract technology.

However, SOC analysts face challenges in handling adaptive adversarial tactics, requiring intelligent decision-support frameworks. We propose a Cognitive Hierarchy Theory-driven Deep Q-Network (CHT-DQN) framework that models interactive decision-making between SOC analysts and AI-driven APT bots. The SOC analyst (defender) operates at cognitive level-1, anticipating attacker strategies, while the APT bot (attacker) follows a level-0 policy. By incorporating CHT into DQN, our framework enhances adaptive SOC defense using Attack Graph (AG)-based reinforcement learning. Simulation experiments across varying AG complexities show that CHT-DQN consistently achieves higher data protection and lower action discrepancies compared to standard DQN. A theoretical lower bound further confirms its superiority as AG complexity increases. A human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) reveals that SOC analysts using CHT-DQN-derived transition probabilities align more closely with adaptive attackers, leading to better defense outcomes. Moreover, human behavior aligns with Prospect Theory (PT) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT): participants are less likely to reselect failed actions and more likely to persist with successful ones. This asymmetry reflects amplified loss sensitivity and biased probability weighting -- underestimating gains after failure and overestimating continued success. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating cognitive models into deep reinforcement learning to improve real-time SOC decision-making for cloud security.",

As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, its ability to synthesise realistic content emerges as a threat in the hands of cybercriminals who seek to manipulate and misrepresent the truth. Such synthetic content introduces a non-trivial risk of overwriting the subtle changes made for the purpose of steganography. When the signals in both the spatial and temporal domains are vulnerable to unforeseen overwriting, it calls for reflection on what, if any, remains invariant. This study proposes a paradigm in steganography for audiovisual media, where messages are concealed beyond both spatial and temporal domains. A chain of multimodal artificial intelligence is developed to deconstruct audiovisual content into a cover text, embed a message within the linguistic domain, and then reconstruct the audiovisual content through synchronising both auditory and visual modalities with the resultant stego text. The message is encoded by biasing the word sampling process of a language generation model and decoded by analysing the probability distribution of word choices. The accuracy of message transmission is evaluated under both zero-bit and multi-bit capacity settings. Fidelity is assessed through both biometric and semantic similarities, capturing the identities of the recorded face and voice, as well as the core ideas conveyed through the media. Secrecy is examined through statistical comparisons between cover and stego texts. Robustness is tested across various scenarios, including audiovisual resampling, face-swapping, voice-cloning and their combinations.",

However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines.

Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution, allowing decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy to solve these issues.

In the first phase, local models are evaluated using a validation dataset to generate validation scores.

The challenge in designing such a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) protocol, is using the native computation of $T(x)$ to produce a PoW certificate with prescribed hardness and with negligible computational overhead over the worst-case complexity of $T(\\cdot)$ -- This ensures malicious miners cannot ``game the system\" by fooling the verifier to accept with higher probability compared to honest miners (while using similar computational resources). Indeed, obtaining a PoUW with $O(1)$-factor overhead is trivial for any task $T$, but also useless.\n  Our main result is a PoUW for the task of Matrix Multiplication $MatMul(A,B)$ of arbitrary matrices with $1+o(1)$ multiplicative overhead compared to naive $MatMul$ (even in the presence of Fast Matrix Multiplication-style algorithms, which are currently impractical). We conjecture that our protocol has optimal security in the sense that a malicious prover cannot obtain any significant advantage over an honest prover. This conjecture is based on reducing hardness of our protocol to the task of solving a batch of low-rank random linear equations which is of independent interest.\n  Since $MatMul$s are the bottleneck of AI compute as well as countless industry-scale applications, this primitive suggests a concrete design of a new L1 base-layer protocol, which nearly eliminates the energy-waste of Bitcoin mining -- allowing GPU consumers to reduce their AI training and inference costs by ``re-using\" it for blockchain consensus, in exchange for block rewards (2-for-1).

On Intel processors, one of the main challenges for identifying contending addresses is the sliced cache design, where the processor hashes the physical address to determine where in the cache a memory location is stored. While past works have demonstrated that the hash function can be reversed, they also showed that it depends on physical address bits that the adversary does not know.\n  In this work, we make three main contributions to the art of finding eviction sets. We first exploit microarchitectural races to compare memory access times and identify the cache slice to which an address maps. We then use the known hash function to both reduce the error rate in our slice identification method and to reduce the work by extrapolating slice mappings to untested memory addresses. Finally, we show how to propagate information on eviction sets across different page offsets for the hitherto unexplored case of non-linear hash functions.\n  Our contributions allow for entire LLC eviction set generation in 0.7 seconds on the Intel i7-9850H and 1.6 seconds on the i9-10900K, both using non-linear functions.

Under this privacy model, we study three classical statistical problems: univariate mean estimation, low-dimensional linear regression, and high-dimensional linear regression.

This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed universal meta-initialized and gradient robust adversarial attack (UMI-GRAT) toward SAMs and their downstream models.

From whispers in shadows to the enigmatic notes written in the margins of history, humanity has long sought ways to convey thoughts that remain imperceptible to all but the chosen few. The challenge of subliminal communication has been addressed in various forms of steganography. However, the field faces a fundamental paradox: as the art of concealment advances, so too does the science of revelation, leading to an ongoing evolutionary interplay. This study seeks to extend the boundaries of what is considered a viable steganographic medium. We explore a steganographic paradigm, in which hidden information is communicated through the episodes of multiple agents interacting with an environment. Each agent, acting as an encoder, learns a policy to disguise the very existence of hidden messages within actions seemingly directed toward innocent objectives. Meanwhile, an observer, serving as a decoder, learns to associate behavioural patterns with their respective agents despite their dynamic nature, thereby unveiling the hidden messages. The interactions of agents are governed by the framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning and shaped by feedback from the observer. This framework encapsulates a game-theoretic dilemma, wherein agents face decisions between cooperating to create distinguishable behavioural patterns or defecting to pursue individually optimal yet potentially overlapping episodic actions. As a proof of concept, we exemplify action steganography through the game of labyrinth, a navigation task where subliminal communication is concealed within the act of steering toward a destination, and systematically validate the stego-system in terms of distortion, capacity, secrecy and robustness when subjected to simulated passive and active adversaries.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2503.09002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels. However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large systems remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.\n  We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks scalable LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive systems, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 92 new, critical, long-latent bugs (average 4.3 years) in the Linux kernel; 77 are confirmed, 57 fixed, and 16 have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.12546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We formalise the notion of an anonymous public announcement in the tradition of public announcement logic. Such announcements can be seen as in-between a public announcement from ``the outside\" (an announcement of $\\phi$) and a public announcement by one of the agents (an announcement of $K_a\\phi$): we get more information than just $\\phi$, but not (necessarily) about exactly who made it. Even if such an announcement is prima facie anonymous, depending on the background knowledge of the agents it might reveal the identity of the announcer: if I post something on a message board, the information might reveal who I am even if I don't sign my name. Furthermore, like in the Russian Cards puzzle, if we assume that the announcer's intention was to stay anonymous, that in fact might reveal more information. In this paper we first look at the case when no assumption about intentions are made, in which case the logic with an anonymous public announcement operator is reducible to epistemic logic. We then look at the case when we assume common knowledge of the intention to stay anonymous, which is both more complex and more interesting: in several ways it boils down to the notion of a ``safe\" announcement (again, similarly to Russian Cards). Main results include formal expressivity results and axiomatic completeness for key logical languages.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.13775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models (BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.",
