        "summary": "arXiv:2504.11575v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in Multi-Environment (M-En) networks presents significant challenges due to diverse malicious traffic patterns and the evolving nature of cyber threats. Existing AI-based detection systems struggle to adapt to new attack strategies and lack real-time attack detection capabilities with high accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes an online, continuous learning methodology for DDoS detection in M-En networks, enabling continuous model updates and real-time adaptation to emerging threats, including zero-day attacks. First, we develop a unique M-En network dataset by setting up a realistic, real-time simulation using the NS-3 tool, incorporating both victim and bot devices. DDoS attacks with varying packet sizes are simulated using the DDoSim application across IoT and traditional IP-based environments under M-En network criteria. Our approach employs a multi-level framework (MULTI-LF) featuring two machine learning models: a lightweight Model 1 (M1) trained on a selective, critical packet dataset for fast and efficient initial detection, and a more complex, highly accurate Model 2 (M2) trained on extensive data. When M1 exhibits low confidence in its predictions, the decision is escalated to M2 for verification and potential fine-tuning of M1 using insights from M2. If both models demonstrate low confidence, the system flags the incident for human intervention, facilitating model updates with human-verified categories to enhance adaptability to unseen attack patterns. We validate the MULTI-LF through real-world simulations, demonstrating superior classification accuracy of 0.999 and low prediction latency of 0.866 seconds compared to established baselines. Furthermore, we evaluate performance in terms of memory usage (3.632 MB) and CPU utilization (10.05%) in real-time scenarios.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.11604v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many real-world applications, such as machine learning and graph analytics, involve combinations of linear and non-linear operations. As these applications increasingly handle sensitive data, there is a significant demand for privacy-preserving computation techniques capable of efficiently supporting both types of operations-a property we define as \"computational universality.\" Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has emerged as a powerful approach to perform computations directly on encrypted data. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and measure whether existing FHE methods achieve computational universality or primarily favor either linear or non-linear operations, especially in non-interactive settings. We evaluate FHE universality in three stages. First, we categorize existing FHE methods into ten distinct approaches and analyze their theoretical complexities, selecting the three most promising universal candidates. Next, we perform measurements on representative workloads that combine linear and non-linear operations in various sequences, assessing performance across different bit lengths and with SIMD parallelization enabled or disabled. Finally, we empirically evaluate these candidates on five real-world, privacy-sensitive applications, where each involving arithmetic (linear) and comparison-like (non-linear) operations. Our findings indicate significant overheads in current universal FHE solutions, with efficiency strongly influenced by SIMD parallelism, word-wise versus bit-wise operations, and the trade-off between approximate and exact computations. Additionally, our analysis provides practical guidance to help practitioners select the most suitable universal FHE schemes and algorithms based on specific application requirements.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.11622v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The large integration of microphones into devices increases the opportunities for Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks (ASCAs), as these can be used to capture keystrokes' audio signals that might reveal sensitive information. However, the current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) models for ASCAs, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and hybrid models, such as CoAtNet, still exhibit limited robustness under realistic noisy conditions. Solving this problem requires either: (i) an increased model's capacity to infer contextual information from longer sequences, allowing the model to learn that an initially noisily typed word is the same as a futurely collected non-noisy word, or (ii) an approach to fix misidentified information from the contexts, as one does not type random words, but the ones that best fit the conversation context. In this paper, we demonstrate that both strategies are viable and complementary solutions for making ASCAs practical. We observed that no existing solution leverages advanced transformer architectures' power for these tasks and propose that: (i) Visual Transformers (VTs) are the candidate solutions for capturing long-term contextual information and (ii) transformer-powered Large Language Models (LLMs) are the candidate solutions to fix the ``typos'' (mispredictions) the model might make. Thus, we here present the first-of-its-kind approach that integrates VTs and LLMs for ASCAs.\n  We first show that VTs achieve SOTA performance in classifying keystrokes when compared to the previous CNN benchmark. Second, we demonstrate that LLMs can mitigate the impact of real-world noise. Evaluations on the natural sentences revealed that: (i) incorporating LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in our ASCA pipeline boosts the performance of error-correction tasks; and (ii) the comparable performance can be attained by a lightweight, fine-tuned smaller LLM (67 times smaller than GPT-4o), using...",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.11633v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: There is a growing class of static physical side-channel attacks that allow adversaries to extract secrets by probing the persistent state of a circuit. Techniques such as laser logic state imaging (LLSI), impedance analysis (IA), and static power analysis fall into this category. These attacks require that the targeted data remain constant for a specific duration, which often necessitates halting the circuit's clock. Some methods additionally rely on modulating the chip's supply voltage to probe the circuit. However, tampering with the clock or voltage is typically assumed to be detectable, as secure chips often deploy sensors that erase sensitive data upon detecting such anomalies. Furthermore, many secure devices use internal clock sources, making external clock control infeasible. In this work, we introduce a novel class of static side-channel attacks, called Chypnosis, that enables adversaries to freeze a chip's internal clock by inducing a hibernation state via rapid undervolting, and then extracting secrets using static side-channels. We demonstrate that, by rapidly dropping a chip's voltage below the standard nominal levels, the attacker can bypass the clock and voltage sensors and put the chip in a so-called brownout condition, in which the chip's transistors stop switching, but volatile memories (e.g., Flip-flops and SRAMs) still retain their data. We test our attack on AMD FPGAs by putting them into hibernation. We show that not only are all clock sources deactivated, but various clock and voltage sensors also fail to detect the tamper event. Afterward, we present the successful recovery of secret bits from a hibernated chip using two static attacks, namely, LLSI and IA. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures which could be integrated into future designs.",

We examine the theoretical foundations of entropy-based security, analyze real-world implementations including Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Moving Target Defense (MTD) frameworks, evaluate practical challenges in implementation, and compare entropy-based approaches with traditional security methods. Our methodology includes a systematic analysis of entropy's role across various security domains, from cryptographic operations to system-level defenses. Results demonstrate that entropy injection can significantly reduce attack probability, with some implementations showing more than 90% reduction with minimal performance impact. The discussion highlights the trade-offs between security benefits and operational complexity, while identifying future directions for entropy-enhanced security, including integration with artificial intelligence and quantum randomness sources. We conclude that entropy injection represents a paradigm shift from reactive defense to proactive uncertainty management, offering a strategic approach that can fundamentally alter the balance between attackers and defenders in cybersecurity.",

Despite their great potential, LLM agents pose significant security risks. When interacting with the external world, they may encounter malicious commands from attackers, leading to the execution of dangerous actions. A promising way to address this is by enforcing the principle of least privilege: allowing only essential actions for task completion while blocking unnecessary ones. However, achieving this is challenging, as it requires covering diverse agent scenarios while preserving both security and utility.\n  We introduce Progent, the first privilege control mechanism for LLM agents. At its core is a domain-specific language for flexibly expressing privilege control policies applied during agent execution. These policies provide fine-grained constraints over tool calls, deciding when tool calls are permissible and specifying fallbacks if they are not. This enables agent developers and users to craft suitable policies for their specific use cases and enforce them deterministically to guarantee security. Thanks to its modular design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and requires only minimal changes to agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and potential for widespread adoption. To automate policy writing, we leverage LLMs to generate policies based on user queries, which are then updated dynamically for improved security and utility. Our extensive evaluation shows that it enables strong security while preserving high utility across three distinct scenarios or benchmarks: AgentDojo, ASB, and AgentPoison. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis, showcasing the effectiveness of its core components and the resilience of its automated policy generation against adaptive attacks.",

Unfortunately, cryptocurrency wallets have always been the prime targets for attackers, and incidents of wallet breaches have been reported from time to time. Although some recent studies have characterized the vulnerabilities and scams related to wallets, they have generally been characterized in coarse granularity, overlooking potential risks inherent in detailed designs of cryptocurrency wallets, especially from perspectives including user interaction and advanced features. To fill the void, in this paper, we present a fine-grained security analysis on browser-based cryptocurrency wallets. To pinpoint security issues of components in wallets, we design WalletProbe, a mutation-based testing framework based on visual-level oracles. We have identified 13 attack vectors that can be abused by attackers to exploit cryptocurrency wallets and exposed 21 concrete attack strategies. By applying WalletProbe on 39 widely-adopted browser-based wallet extensions, we astonishingly figure out all of them can be abused to steal crypto assets from innocent users. Identified potential attack vectors were reported to wallet developers timely and 26 issues have been patched already.

In the absence of valid keys, the system deliberately degrades output quality, effectively preventing unauthorized exploitation.Importantly, while the primary mechanism enforces active access control through architectural intervention, its decoupled design retains compatibility with existing watermarking techniques. This satisfies the need of model owners to actively control model ownership while preserving the traceability capabilities provided by traditional watermarking approaches.Extensive experimental evaluations confirm a strong dependency between credential verification and image quality across various attack scenarios. Moreover, when combined with typical post-processing operations, PCDIFF demonstrates powerful performance alongside conventional watermarking methods.

To address this, we develop CSEBenchmark, a fine-grained cybersecurity evaluation framework based on 345 knowledge points expected of cybersecurity experts. Drawing from cognitive science, these points are categorized into factual, conceptual, and procedural types, enabling the design of 11,050 tailored multiple-choice questions. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs on CSEBenchmark and find that even the best-performing model achieves only 85.42% overall accuracy, with particular knowledge gaps in the use of specialized tools and uncommon commands. Different LLMs have unique knowledge gaps. Even large models from the same family may perform poorly on knowledge points where smaller models excel. By identifying and addressing specific knowledge gaps in each LLM, we achieve up to an 84% improvement in correcting previously incorrect predictions across three existing benchmarks for two cybersecurity tasks. Furthermore, our assessment of each LLM's knowledge alignment with specific cybersecurity roles reveals that different models align better with different roles, such as GPT-4o for the Google Senior Intelligence Analyst and Deepseek-V3 for the Amazon Privacy Engineer.

This is because their owners are often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and technically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their functionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of mixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying topological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's modus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract dense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar communities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from external sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role in mixer operations.

This need becomes even more critical in hard-to-access or sensitive systems, such as those used in space applications, passenger transportation, and the financial sector. In this context, Error Correction Codes (ECCs) are essential tools for ensuring a certain level of reliability. This work proposes a technique to enhance ECC error correction capability by overlapping data regions. The approach consists of protecting the same data area with multiple ECCs organized in a two-dimensional structure, enabling logical inferences that correlate the codes and improve their error detection and correction capabilities. More specifically, the overlapping is characterized by the organization of multiple ECCs, whose intersection exclusively covers the entire data region. Different configurations of overlapping ECCs were analyzed to evaluate the proposal regarding error detection and correction capability, scalability, and reliability. Experimental results confirm the technique's effectiveness and demonstrate its high scalability potential, reducing the need for redundancy bits relative to the number of data bits. Furthermore, comparisons with state-of-the-art ECC approaches indicate the technique's applicability in critical systems that require high reliability.",

However, the computation, data and results are prone to tampering due to the vulnerabilities on the server side. Thus, verifying the integrity of computation is important in the client-server setting. The cryptographic method known as Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is renowned for facilitating private and verifiable computing. ZKP allows the client to validate that the results from the server are computed correctly without violating the privacy of the server's intellectual property. Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), in particular, has been widely applied in various applications like blockchain and verifiable machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing zkSNARKs approaches remain highly computationally intensive. For instance, even basic operations like matrix multiplication require an extensive number of constraints, resulting in significant overhead. In addressing this challenge, we introduce \\textit{zkVC}, which optimizes the ZKP computation for matrix multiplication, enabling rapid proof generation on the server side and efficient verification on the client side. zkVC integrates optimized ZKP modules, such as Constraint-reduced Polynomial Circuit (CRPC) and Prefix-Sum Query (PSQ), collectively yielding a more than 12-fold increase in proof speed over prior methods.

Recent works have strengthened safety with accountability: should any safety violation occur, a sizable fraction of adversary nodes can be proven to be protocol violators. This paper studies to what extent analogous accountability guarantees are achievable for liveness. To reveal the full complexity of this question, we introduce an interpolation between the classical synchronous and partially-synchronous models that we call the $x$-partially-synchronous network model in which, intuitively, at most an $x$ fraction of the time steps in any sufficiently long interval are asynchronous (and, as with a partially-synchronous network, all time steps are synchronous following the passage of an unknown \"global stablization time\"). We prove a precise characterization of the parameter regime in which accountable liveness is achievable: if and only if $x < 1/2$ and $f < n/2$, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes and $f$ the number of nodes controlled by an adversary. We further refine the problem statement and our analysis by parameterizing by the number of violating nodes identified following a liveness violation, and provide evidence that the guarantees achieved by our protocol are near-optimal (as a function of $x$ and $f$). Our results provide rigorous foundations for liveness-accountability heuristics such as the \"inactivity leaks\" employed in Ethereum.",

Attackers exploit partially exposed user profiles in recommendation models, such as user embeddings, to infer private attributes of target users, such as gender and political views. The goal of defenders is to mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks while maintaining recommendation performance. Most existing defense methods, such as differential privacy and attribute unlearning, focus on post-training settings, which limits their capability of utilizing training data to preserve recommendation performance. Although adversarial training extends defenses to in-training settings, it often struggles with convergence due to unstable training processes. In this paper, we propose RAID, an in-training defense method against attribute inference attacks in recommender systems. In addition to the recommendation objective, we define a defensive objective to ensure that the distribution of protected attributes becomes independent of class labels, making users indistinguishable from attribute inference attacks. Specifically, this defensive objective aims to solve a constrained Wasserstein barycenter problem to identify the centroid distribution that makes the attribute indistinguishable while complying with recommendation performance constraints. To optimize our proposed objective, we use optimal transport to align users with the centroid distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to evaluate RAID. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of RAID and demonstrate its significant superiority over existing methods in multiple aspects.",

A user behaviour analysis pipeline was proposed to present how this type of information can be extracted and analysed to identify separate behavioural clusters that can describe how users behave in the game. The pipeline starts with the collection of transaction data, involving smart contracts, that is collected from a blockchain-based game called Planet IX. Both the raw transaction information and the transaction events are considered in the data collection. From this data, separate game actions can be formed and those are leveraged to present how and when the users conducted their in-game activities in the form of user flows. An extended version of these user flows also presents how the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are being leveraged in the user actions. The latter is given as input for a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to provide graph embeddings for these flows which then can be leveraged by clustering algorithms to cluster user behaviours into separate behavioural clusters. We benchmark and compare well-known clustering algorithms as a part of the proposed method. The user behaviour clusters were analysed and visualised in a graph format. It was found that behavioural information can be extracted regarding the users that belong to these clusters. Such information can be exploited by malicious users to their advantage. To demonstrate this, a privacy threat model was also presented based on the results that correspond to multiple potentially affected areas.",

Intuitively, security issues in EVMs could lead to inconsistent behaviors among smart contracts or even denial-of-service of the entire blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of studies focus on the security of EVMs. Moreover, they suffer from 1) insufficient test input diversity and invalid semantics; and 2) the inability to automatically identify bugs and locate root causes. To bridge this gap, we propose OpDiffer, a differential testing framework for EVM, which takes advantage of LLMs and static analysis methods to address the above two limitations. We conducted the largest-scale evaluation, covering nine EVMs and uncovering 26 previously unknown bugs, 22 of which have been confirmed by developers and three have been assigned CNVD IDs. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, OpDiffer can improve code coverage by at most 71.06%, 148.40% and 655.56%, respectively.

By implication, it is possible that humans or unwatermarked LLMs could unintentionally mimic properties of LLM generated text, making counter measures unreliable. In this work we investigate the extent to which such conversational adaptation happens. We call the concept $\\textit{mimicry}$ and demonstrate that both humans and LLMs end up mimicking, including the watermarking signal even in seemingly improbable settings.

The ever-evolving digital landscape has gone through many technological transformations that have also affected the way entities are digitally identified. During this digital evolution, identity management has shifted from centralized to decentralized approaches. The last era of this journey is represented by the emerging Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which gives users full control over their data. SSI leverages decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs), which have been recently standardized by the World Wide Web Community (W3C). These technologies have the potential to build more secure and decentralized digital identity systems, remarkably contributing to strengthening the security of communications that typically involve many distributed participants. It is worth noting that the scope of DIDs and VCs extends beyond individuals, encompassing a broad range of entities including cloud, edge, and Internet of Things (IoT) resources. However, due to their novelty, existing literature lacks a comprehensive survey on how DIDs and VCs have been employed in different application domains, which go beyond SSI systems. This paper provides readers with a comprehensive overview of such technologies from different perspectives. Specifically, we first provide the background on DIDs and VCs.

However, studies have revealed privacy vulnerabilities in FL, where adversaries can potentially infer sensitive information from the shared model parameters. In this paper, we present an efficient masking-based secure aggregation scheme utilizing lightweight cryptographic primitives to mitigate privacy risks. Our scheme offers several advantages over existing methods. First, it requires only a single setup phase for the entire FL training session, significantly reducing communication overhead. Second, it minimizes user-side overhead by eliminating the need for user-to-user interactions, utilizing an intermediate server layer and a lightweight key negotiation method. Third, the scheme is highly resilient to user dropouts, and the users can join at any FL round. Fourth, it can detect and defend against malicious server activities, including recently discovered model inconsistency attacks. Finally, our scheme ensures security in both semi-honest and malicious settings. We provide security analysis to formally prove the robustness of our approach.

CYLENS is designed to assist security professionals throughout the entire threat management lifecycle, supporting threat attribution, contextualization, detection, correlation, prioritization, and remediation. To ensure domain expertise, CYLENS integrates knowledge from 271,570 threat reports into its model parameters and incorporates six specialized NLP modules to enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, CYLENS can be customized to meet the unique needs of different or ganizations, underscoring its adaptability. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that CYLENS consistently outperforms industry-leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents. By detailing its design, development, and evaluation, this work provides a blueprint for leveraging LLMs to address complex, data-intensive cybersecurity challenges.",

Two-server ORAM, designed for secure two-party RAM computation, stores data across two non-colluding servers. However, many two-server ORAM schemes suffer from excessive local storage or high bandwidth costs. To serve lightweight clients, it is crucial for ORAM to achieve concretely efficient bandwidth while maintaining O(1) local storage. Hence, this paper presents two new client-friendly two-server ORAM schemes that achieve practical logarithmic bandwidth under O(1) local storage, while incurring linear symmetric key computations. The core design features a hierarchical structure and a pairwise-area setting for the elements and their tags. Accordingly, we specify efficient read-only and write-only private information retrieval (PIR) algorithms in our schemes to ensure obliviousness in accessing two areas respectively, so as to avoid the necessity of costly shuffle techniques in previous works. We empirically evaluate our schemes against LO13 (TCC'13), AFN17 (PKC'17), and KM19 (PKC'19) in terms of both bandwidth and time cost. The results demonstrate that our schemes reduce bandwidth by approximately 2-4x compared to LO13, and by 16-64x compared to AFN17 and KM19. For a database of size 2^14 blocks, our schemes are over 64x faster than KM19, while achieving similar performance to LO13 and AFN17 in the WAN setting, with a latency of around 1 second.",

To analyze and quantify this amplification effect, two primary frameworks have been proposed: the \\textit{privacy blanket} (Balle et al., CRYPTO 2019) and the \\textit{clone paradigm}, which includes both the \\textit{standard clone} and \\textit{stronger clone} (Feldman et al., FOCS 2021; SODA 2023). All of these approaches are grounded in decomposing the behavior of local randomizers.\n  In this work, we present a unified perspective--termed the \\textit{general clone paradigm}--that captures all decomposition-based analyses. We identify the optimal decomposition within this framework and design a simple yet efficient algorithm based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to compute tight privacy amplification bounds. Empirical results show that our computed upper bounds nearly match the corresponding lower bounds, demonstrating the accuracy and tightness of our method.\n  Furthermore, we apply our algorithm to derive optimal privacy amplification bounds for both joint composition and parallel composition of LDP mechanisms in the shuffle model.",

The challenge in designing such a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) protocol, is using the native computation of $T(x)$ to produce a PoW certificate with prescribed hardness and with negligible computational overhead over the worst-case complexity of $T(\\cdot)$ -- This ensures malicious miners cannot ``game the system\" by fooling the verifier to accept with higher probability compared to honest miners (while using similar computational resources). Indeed, obtaining a PoUW with $O(1)$-factor overhead is trivial for any task $T$, but also useless.\n  Our main result is a PoUW for the task of Matrix Multiplication $MatMul(A,B)$ of arbitrary matrices with $1+o(1)$ multiplicative overhead compared to naive $MatMul$ (even in the presence of Fast Matrix Multiplication-style algorithms, which are currently impractical). We conjecture that our protocol has optimal security in the sense that a malicious prover cannot obtain any significant advantage over an honest prover. This conjecture is based on reducing hardness of our protocol to the task of solving a batch of low-rank random linear equations which is of independent interest.\n  Since $MatMul$s are the bottleneck of AI compute as well as countless industry-scale applications, this primitive suggests a concrete design of a new L1 base-layer protocol, which nearly eliminates the energy-waste of Bitcoin mining -- allowing GPU consumers to reduce their AI training and inference costs by ``re-using\" it for blockchain consensus, in exchange for block rewards (2-for-1).

Currently, there is still a significant challenge in identifying suspicious training data to unveil potential backdoor samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Prediction Shift Backdoor Detection (PSBD), leveraging an uncertainty-based approach requiring minimal unlabeled clean validation data. PSBD is motivated by an intriguing Prediction Shift (PS) phenomenon, where poisoned models' predictions on clean data often shift away from true labels towards certain other labels with dropout applied during inference, while backdoor samples exhibit less PS. We hypothesize PS results from the neuron bias effect, making neurons favor features of certain classes. PSBD identifies backdoor training samples by computing the Prediction Shift Uncertainty (PSU), the variance in probability values when dropout layers are toggled on and off during model inference. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PSBD, which achieves state-of-the-art results among mainstream detection methods.

Thus far, previously known edge-differentially private algorithms for most graph problems including densest subgraph and matchings in the continual release setting only output real-value estimates (not vertex subset solutions) and do not use sublinear space. Instead, they rely on computing exact graph statistics on the input [FHO21,SLMVC18]. In this paper, we leverage sparsification to address the above shortcomings for edge-insertion streams. Our edge-differentially private algorithms use sublinear space with respect to the number of edges in the graph while some also achieve sublinear space in the number of vertices in the graph. In addition, for the densest subgraph problem, we also output edge-differentially private vertex subset solutions; no previous graph algorithms in the continual release model output such subsets.\n  We make novel use of assorted sparsification techniques from the non-private streaming and static graph algorithms literature to achieve new results in the sublinear space, continual release setting. This includes algorithms for densest subgraph, maximum matching, as well as the first continual release $k$-core decomposition algorithm. We also develop a novel sparse level data structure for $k$-core decomposition that may be of independent interest. To complement our insertion-only algorithms, we conclude with polynomial additive error lower bounds for edge-privacy in the fully dynamic setting, where only logarithmic lower bounds were previously known.",

However, recent studies have revealed that the training phase of FL is vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, such as attribute inference attacks (AIA), where adversaries exploit exchanged messages and auxiliary public information to uncover sensitive attributes of targeted clients. While these attacks have been extensively studied in the context of classification tasks, their impact on regression tasks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing novel model-based AIAs specifically designed for regression tasks in FL environments. Our approach considers scenarios where adversaries can either eavesdrop on exchanged messages or directly interfere with the training process. We benchmark our proposed attacks against state-of-the-art methods using real-world datasets. The results demonstrate a significant increase in reconstruction accuracy, particularly in heterogeneous client datasets, a common scenario in FL. The efficacy of our model-based AIAs makes them better candidates for empirically quantifying privacy leakage for federated regression tasks.",

These problems are especially common in closed-source large language models (LLMs), where user data is collected and used with full transparency. To address these issues, blockchain-based decentralized AI (DeAI) has been introduced. DeAI leverages the strengths of blockchain technologies to enhance the transparency, security, decentralization, as well as trustworthiness of AI systems. Although DeAI has been widely developed in industry, a comprehensive understanding of state-of-the-art practical DeAI solutions is still lacking. In this work, we present a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) for blockchain-based DeAI solutions. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing DeAI protocols based on the model lifecycle. Based on this taxonomy, we provide a structured way to clarify the landscape of DeAI protocols and identify their similarities and differences. Specifically, we analyze the functionalities of blockchain in DeAI, investigate how blockchain features contribute to enhancing the security, transparency, and trustworthiness of AI processes, and also ensure fair incentives for AI data and model contributors.

However, most existing autonomous defensive agents have overlooked the inherent graph structure of computer networks subject to cyber attacks, potentially missing critical information and constraining their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we developed a custom version of the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment, encoding network state as a directed graph with realistic low-level features. We employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture to process node, edge, and global features, and adapt its output to be compatible with policy gradient methods in RL. Our GAT-based approach offers key advantages over flattened alternatives: policies that demonstrate resilience to certain types of unexpected dynamic network topology changes, reasonable generalisation to networks of varying sizes within the same structural distribution, and interpretable defensive actions grounded in tangible network properties. We demonstrate that GAT defensive policies can be trained using our low-level directed graph observations, even when unexpected connections arise during simulation. Evaluations across networks of different sizes, but consistent subnetwork structure, show our policies achieve comparable performance to policies trained specifically for each network configuration. Our study contributes to the development of robust cyber defence systems that can better adapt to real-world network security challenges.",
