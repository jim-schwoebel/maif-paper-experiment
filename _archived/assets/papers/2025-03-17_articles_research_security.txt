        "summary": "arXiv:2503.10793v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As an emerging programming language, Rust has rapidly gained popularity and recognition among developers due to its strong emphasis on safety. It employs a unique ownership system and safe concurrency practices to ensure robust safety. Despite these safeguards, security in Rust still presents challenges. Since 2018, 442 Rust-related vulnerabilities have been reported in real-world applications. The limited availability of data has resulted in existing vulnerability detection tools performing poorly in real-world scenarios, often failing to adapt to new and complex vulnerabilities. This paper introduces HALURust, a novel framework that leverages hallucinations of large language models (LLMs) to detect vulnerabilities in real-world Rust scenarios. HALURust leverages LLMs' strength in natural language generation by transforming code into detailed vulnerability analysis reports. The key innovation lies in prompting the LLM to always assume the presence of a vulnerability. If the code sample is vulnerable, the LLM provides an accurate analysis; if not, it generates a hallucinated report. By fine-tuning LLMs on these hallucinations, HALURust can effectively distinguish between vulnerable and non-vulnerable code samples. HALURust was evaluated on a dataset of 81 real-world vulnerabilities, covering 447 functions and 18,691 lines of code across 54 applications. It outperformed existing methods, achieving an F1 score of 77.3%, with over 10% improvement. The hallucinated report-based fine-tuning improved detection by 20\\% compared to traditional code-based fine-tuning. Additionally, HALURust effectively adapted to unseen vulnerabilities and other programming languages, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2503.10809v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in operating system (OS) agents enable vision-language models to interact directly with the graphical user interface of an OS. These multimodal OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single prompt via application programming interfaces (APIs). Such APIs typically support low-level operations, including mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and screenshot captures. We introduce a novel attack vector: malicious image patches (MIPs) that have been adversarially perturbed so that, when captured in a screenshot, they cause an OS agent to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, MIPs embedded in desktop backgrounds or shared on social media can redirect an agent to a malicious website, enabling further exploitation. These MIPs generalise across different user requests and screen layouts, and remain effective for multiple OS agents. The existence of such attacks highlights critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents, which should be carefully addressed before their widespread adoption.",

Evading WAFs can compromise these defenses, potentially harming Internet users. In recent years, parsing discrepancies have plagued many entities in the communication path; however, their potential impact on WAF evasion and request smuggling remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present an innovative approach to bypassing WAFs by uncovering and exploiting parsing discrepancies through advanced fuzzing techniques. By targeting non-malicious components such as headers and segments of the body and using widely used content-types such as application/json, multipart/form-data, and application/xml, we identified and confirmed 1207 bypasses across 5 well-known WAFs, AWS, Azure, Cloud Armor, Cloudflare, and ModSecurity. To validate our findings, we conducted a study in the wild, revealing that more than 90% of websites accepted both form/x-www-form-urlencoded and multipart/form-data interchangeably, highlighting a significant vulnerability and the broad applicability of our bypass techniques. We have reported these vulnerabilities to the affected parties and received acknowledgments from all, as well as bug bounty rewards from some vendors. Further, to mitigate these vulnerabilities, we introduce HTTP-Normalizer, a robust proxy tool designed to rigorously validate HTTP requests against current RFC standards. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness in normalizing or blocking all bypass attempts presented in this work.",

These attacks exploit LLMs' difficulty in dynamically detecting harmful intents during the generation process. Traditional safety alignment methods, often relying on the initial few generation steps, are ineffective due to limited computational budget. This paper proposes DEEPALIGN, a robust defense framework that fine-tunes LLMs to progressively detoxify generated content, significantly improving both the computational budget and effectiveness of mitigating harmful generation. Our approach uses a hybrid loss function operating on hidden states to directly improve LLMs' inherent awareness of toxity during generation. Furthermore, we redefine safe responses by generating semantically relevant answers to harmful queries, thereby increasing robustness against representation-mutation attacks. Evaluations across multiple LLMs demonstrate state-of-the-art defense performance against six different attack types, reducing Attack Success Rates by up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art defense while preserving utility. This work advances LLM safety by addressing limitations of conventional alignment through dynamic, context-aware mitigation.",

However, recent studies have revealed that private information can still be leaked through shared gradient information and attacked by Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA). While many GIA methods have been proposed, a detailed analysis, evaluation, and summary of these methods are still lacking. Although various survey papers summarize existing privacy attacks in FL, few studies have conducted extensive experiments to unveil the effectiveness of GIA and their associated limiting factors in this context. To fill this gap, we first undertake a systematic review of GIA and categorize existing methods into three types, i.e., \\textit{optimization-based} GIA (OP-GIA), \\textit{generation-based} GIA (GEN-GIA), and \\textit{analytics-based} GIA (ANA-GIA). Then, we comprehensively analyze and evaluate the three types of GIA in FL, providing insights into the factors that influence their performance, practicality, and potential threats. Our findings indicate that OP-GIA is the most practical attack setting despite its unsatisfactory performance, while GEN-GIA has many dependencies and ANA-GIA is easily detectable, making them both impractical. Finally, we offer a three-stage defense pipeline to users when designing FL frameworks and protocols for better privacy protection and share some future research directions from the perspectives of attackers and defenders that we believe should be pursued. We hope that our study can help researchers design more robust FL frameworks to defend against these attacks.",

Building on these insights, we propose ESIII (Embedding Security Instructions Into Images), a novel methodology for transforming the visual space from a source of vulnerability into an active defense mechanism. Initially, we embed security instructions into defensive images through gradient-based optimization, obtaining security instructions in the visual dimension. Subsequently, we integrate security instructions from visual and textual dimensions with the input query. The collaboration between security instructions from different dimensions ensures comprehensive security protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively fortifies the robustness of LVLMs against such attacks while preserving their performance on standard benign tasks and incurring an imperceptible increase in time costs.",

Empirical results indicate that LLaMA 3.1 (8B) exhibits a robust capability in detecting adversarial inputs, whereas Falcon (7B) shows comparatively lower performance. Notably, for the majority of the models, detection success improves as the adversary's confidence decreases; however, this trend is reversed for LLaMA 3.1 (8B) and Phi 3 (3.8B), where a reduction in adversarial confidence corresponds with diminished detection performance.

We argue for using Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) as the primary means of communicating DP guarantees in ML, with the full privacy profile as a secondary option in case GDP is too inaccurate. Unlike other widely used alternatives, GDP has only one parameter, which ensures easy comparability of guarantees, and it can accurately capture the full privacy profile of many important ML applications. To support our claims, we investigate the privacy profiles of state-of-the-art DP large-scale image classification, and the TopDown algorithm for the U.S. Decennial Census, observing that GDP fits the profiles remarkably well in all three cases. Although GDP is ideal for reporting the final guarantees, other formalisms (e.g., privacy loss random variables) are needed for accurate privacy accounting.

We analyze the feasible capability and safety-critical outcomes of an attack on sensing at a cyber level. To further address these threats, we design realistic attacks in AV simulators and real-world datasets under two practical constraints: attackers (1) possess only partial information and (2) are constrained by data structures that maintain sensor integrity.Examining the role of camera and LiDAR in multi-sensor AVs, we find that attacks targeting only the camera have minimal safety impact due to the sensor fusion system's strong reliance on 3D data from LiDAR. This reliance makes LiDAR-based attacks especially detrimental to safety. To mitigate the vulnerabilities, we introduce security-aware sensor fusion incorporating (1) a probabilistic data-asymmetry monitor and (2) a scalable track-to-track fusion of 3D LiDAR and monocular detections (T2T-3DLM).

In this paper, we reveal that SSBAs are not sufficiently stealthy due to their poisoned-label nature, where users can discover anomalies if they check the image-label relationship. In particular, we demonstrate that it is ineffective to directly generalize existing SSBAs to their clean-label variants by poisoning samples solely from the target class. We reveal that it is primarily due to two reasons, including \\textbf{(1)} the `antagonistic effects' of ground-truth features and \\textbf{(2)} the learning difficulty of sample-specific features. Accordingly, trigger-related features of existing SSBAs cannot be effectively learned under the clean-label setting due to their mild trigger intensity required for ensuring stealthiness. We argue that the intensity constraint of existing SSBAs is mostly because their trigger patterns are `content-irrelevant' and therefore act as `noises' for both humans and DNNs. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to exploit content-relevant features, $a.k.a.$ (human-relied) attributes, as the trigger patterns to design clean-label SSBAs. This new attack paradigm is dubbed backdoor attack with attribute trigger (BAAT).

As a result, a large body of research has been focused on kernel fuzzing, i.e., automatically generating syscall (system call) sequences to detect potential kernel bugs or vulnerabilities. Kernel fuzzing aims to generate valid syscall sequences guided by syscall specifications that define both the syntax and semantics of syscalls. While there has been existing work trying to automate syscall specification generation, this remains largely manual work, and a large number of important syscalls are still uncovered.\n  In this paper, we propose KernelGPT, the first approach to automatically synthesizing syscall specifications via Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced kernel fuzzing. Our key insight is that LLMs have seen massive kernel code, documentation, and use cases during pre-training, and thus can automatically distill the necessary information for making valid syscalls. More specifically, KernelGPT leverages an iterative approach to automatically infer the specifications, and further debug and repair them based on the validation feedback. Our results demonstrate that KernelGPT can generate more new and valid specifications and achieve higher coverage than state-of-the-art techniques. So far, by using newly generated specifications, KernelGPT has already detected 24 new unique bugs in Linux kernel, with 12 fixed and 11 assigned with CVE numbers.

Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim models, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors during inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target attacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target) before training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large output space of object detection (including object existence prediction, bounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible, inference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate new ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones, offering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of supported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against region-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack success rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2501.18861v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: JEDEC has introduced the Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) framework for DDR5 and future DRAMs to enable precise counting of DRAM row activations. PRAC enables a holistic mitigation of Rowhammer attacks even at ultra-low Rowhammer thresholds. PRAC uses an Alert Back-Off (ABO) protocol to request the memory controller to issue Rowhammer mitigation requests. However, recent PRAC implementations are either insecure or impractical. For example, Panopticon, the inspiration for PRAC, is rendered insecure if implemented per JEDEC's PRAC specification. On the other hand, the recent UPRAC proposal is impractical since it needs oracular knowledge of the `top-N' activated DRAM rows that require mitigation.\n  This paper provides the first secure, scalable, and practical RowHammer solution using the PRAC framework. The crux of our proposal is the design of a priority-based service queue (PSQ) for mitigations that prioritizes pending mitigations based on activation counts to avoid the security risks of prior solutions. This provides principled security using the reactive ABO protocol. Furthermore, we co-design our PSQ, with opportunistic mitigation on Refresh Management (RFM) operations and proactive mitigation during refresh (REF), to limit the performance impact of ABO-based mitigations. QPRAC provides secure and practical RowHammer mitigation that scales to Rowhammer thresholds as low as 71 while incurring a 0.8% slowdown for benign workloads, which further reduces to 0% with proactive mitigations.",

Such stealthy attacks are challenging to characterize, because message interfaces in standard languages specify each individual message separately but do not specify safe sequences of messages. We present initial results from ongoing work applying refined multiparty session types as a mechanism for expressing and enforcing proper message usage to exclude unsafe sequences. We illustrate our approach by using refined multiparty session types to mitigate safety and security issues in the MAVLink protocol commonly used in UAVs.",

However, achieving both real-time and secure LIC operations on hardware presents significant conceptual and methodological challenges. The present work addresses these challenges by providing an integrated workflow and platform for training, securing, and deploying LIC models on hardware. To this end, a hardware-friendly LIC model is obtained by iteratively pruning and quantizing the model within a standard end-to-end learning framework. Notably, we introduce a novel Quantization-Aware Watermarking (QAW) technique, where the model is watermarked during quantization using a joint loss function, ensuring robust security without compromising model performance. The watermarked weights are then public-key encrypted, guaranteeing both content protection and user traceability. Experimental results across different FPGA platforms evaluate real-time performance, latency, energy consumption, and compression efficiency. The findings highlight that the watermarking and encryption processes maintain negligible impact on compression efficiency (average of -0.4 PSNR) and energy consumption (average of +2%), while still meeting real-time constraints and preserving security properties.",

After all computations are performed on the encrypted data, it can be decrypted to reveal the result. The decrypted value matches the result that would have been obtained if the same computations were applied to the plaintext data.\n  FHE supports basic operations such as addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers. Using these fundamental operations, more complex computations can be constructed, including subtraction, division, logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NAND, MUX), and even advanced mathematical functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos). These functions can be implemented either as exact formulas or as approximations, depending on the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.\n  Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing a server to process the client's data in its encrypted form through an ML model. With FHE, the server learns neither the plaintext version of the input features nor the inference results. Only the client, using their secret key, can decrypt and access the results at the end of the service protocol.FHE can also be applied to confidential blockchain services, ensuring that sensitive data in smart contracts remains encrypted and confidential while maintaining the transparency and integrity of the execution process. Other applications of FHE include secure outsourcing of data analytics, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving searches, efficient multi-party computation for digital signatures, and more.\n  This article is designed to help the reader understand how FHE works from the mathematical level.",

In this work, we introduce \\textit{Poisoned-MRAG}, the first knowledge poisoning attack on multimodal RAG systems. Poisoned-MRAG injects a few carefully crafted image-text pairs into the multimodal knowledge database, manipulating VLMs to generate the attacker-desired response to a target query. Specifically, we formalize the attack as an optimization problem and propose two cross-modal attack strategies, dirty-label and clean-label, tailored to the attacker's knowledge and goals. Our extensive experiments across multiple knowledge databases and VLMs show that Poisoned-MRAG outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 98\\% attack success rate with just five malicious image-text pairs injected into the InfoSeek database (481,782 pairs). Additionally, We evaluate 4 different defense strategies, including paraphrasing, duplicate removal, structure-driven mitigation, and purification, demonstrating their limited effectiveness and trade-offs against Poisoned-MRAG. Our results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of Poisoned-MRAG, underscoring its potential as a significant threat to multimodal RAG systems.",

Our methods provide robust quantum attacks to well-known cryptographic algorithms, more efficiently and with remarkably fewer qubits than previous approaches. We implement simulations of our attacks for symmetric-key protocols such as S-DES, S-AES and Blowfish. For instance, we show how our attack allows a classical simulation of a small 8-qubit quantum computer to find the secret key of one 32-bit Blowfish instance with 24 times fewer number of iterations than a brute-force attack. Our work also shows improvements in attack success rates for lightweight ciphers such as S-DES and S-AES. Further applications beyond symmetric-key cryptography are also discussed, including asymmetric-key protocols and hash functions. In addition, we also comment on potential future improvements of our methods. Our results bring one step closer assessing the vulnerability of large-size classical cryptographic protocols with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and set the stage for future research in quantum cybersecurity.",

In this paper, we analyze the performance of the likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.",

However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk.

However, considering security, capacity, invisibility, and training efficiency, the copyright of 3DGS assets is not well protected as existing watermarking methods are unsuited for its rendering pipeline. In this paper, we propose GuardSplat, an innovative and efficient framework for watermarking 3DGS assets. Specifically, 1) We propose a CLIP-guided pipeline for optimizing the message decoder with minimal costs. The key objective is to achieve high-accuracy extraction by leveraging CLIP's aligning capability and rich representations, demonstrating exceptional capacity and efficiency. 2) We tailor a Spherical-Harmonic-aware (SH-aware) Message Embedding module for 3DGS, seamlessly embedding messages into the SH features of each 3D Gaussian while preserving the original 3D structure. This enables watermarking 3DGS assets with minimal fidelity trade-offs and prevents malicious users from removing the watermarks from the model files, meeting the demands for invisibility and security. 3) We present an Anti-distortion Message Extraction module to improve robustness against various distortions. Experiments demonstrate that GuardSplat outperforms state-of-the-art and achieves fast optimization speed.

The integrity of these components is ensured by the use of provenance tools, of which software signing is the strongest guarantee. While software signing has been recommended by regulation and industry consortia, practical adoption of software signing has been generally limited. While tooling has been recognized as a key factor influencing software signing adoption and quality by previous studies, most research has focused primarily on its user interface aspects, with little research on other usability considerations like tool selection, user challenges, software engineering process integration intricacies, etc.\n  To understand how software tools influence the practice and adoption of software signing, we study the formative usability of Sigstore, a modern and widely adopted software signing tool. We interviewed thirteen (13) experienced security practitioners to study the factors that influence the selection of a tool, the problems associated with the use of such tools, how practitioners' software signing tools have evolved, and what drives this migration. To summarize our findings: (1) We highlight the various factors practitioners consider before adopting a software signing tool; (2) We highlight the problems and advantages associated with the current tooling choices of practitioners; and (3) We describe the evolution of tooling adoption of our sample population. Our findings provide the software signing tool development community with valuable insights to improve their design of software signing tools.",
