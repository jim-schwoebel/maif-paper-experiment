In the European Union, the EUDI Digital Identity wallet is about to become a concrete implementation of this paradigm. However, a debate is still ongoing, partially reflecting some aspects that are not yet consolidated in the scientific state of the art. Among these, an effective, efficient, and privacy-preserving implementation of verifiable credential revocation remains a subject of discussion. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose the basis of a novel method that customizes the use of anonymous hierarchical identity-based encryption to restrict the Verifier access to the temporal authorizations granted by the Holder. This way, the Issuer cannot track the Holder's credential presentations, and the Verifier cannot check revocation information beyond what is permitted by the Holder.",

In the realm of network intrusion detection, the requirement for extensive labeling can become impractically burdensome. Moreover, while IDS training could benefit from inter-company knowledge sharing, the sensitive nature of cybersecurity data often precludes such cooperation. To address these challenges, we propose an IDS architecture that utilizes unsupervised learning to reduce the need for labeling. We further facilitate collaborative learning through the implementation of a federated learning framework. To enhance privacy beyond what current federated clustering models offer, we introduce an innovative federated K-means++ initialization technique. Our findings indicate that transitioning from a centralized to a federated setup does not significantly diminish performance.",

SND is a hard problem, satisfying not only typical security properties (authentication, integrity) but also verification of direct communication, which involves distance estimation based on time measurements and device coordinates. Defeating relay attacks, also known as \"wormholes\", leading to stealthy Byzantine links and significant degradation of communication and adversarial control, is key in many wireless networked systems. However, SND is not concerned with privacy; it necessitates revealing the identity and location of the device(s) participating in the protocol execution. This can be a deterrent for deployment, especially involving user-held devices in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) enabled smart environments. To address this challenge, we present a novel Privacy-Preserving Secure Neighbor Discovery (PP-SND) protocol, enabling devices to perform SND without revealing their actual identities and locations, effectively decoupling discovery from the exposure of sensitive information. We use Homomorphic Encryption (HE) for computing device distances without revealing their actual coordinates, as well as employing a pseudonymous device authentication to hide identities while preserving communication integrity. PP-SND provides SND [1] along with pseudonymity, confidentiality, and unlinkability.

This approach facilitates watermark injection while preserving image quality by adaptively selecting the depth of inversion steps, leveraging our key insight that watermarks degrade with added noise during the early diffusion phases.

The motivation behind such methods is to hide both explicit and implicit identifiers that could be contained in text, while still retaining the semantic meaning of the original text, thus preserving utility. Recent years have seen an uptick in research output in this field, offering a diverse array of word-, sentence-, and document-level DP rewriting methods. Common to these methods is the selection of a privacy budget (i.e., the $\\varepsilon$ parameter), which governs the degree to which a text is privatized. One major limitation of previous works, stemming directly from the unique structure of language itself, is the lack of consideration of $\\textit{where}$ the privacy budget should be allocated, as not all aspects of language, and therefore text, are equally sensitive or personal. In this work, we are the first to address this shortcoming, asking the question of how a given privacy budget can be intelligently and sensibly distributed amongst a target document. We construct and evaluate a toolkit of linguistics- and NLP-based methods used to allocate a privacy budget to constituent tokens in a text document. In a series of privacy and utility experiments, we empirically demonstrate that given the same privacy budget, intelligent distribution leads to higher privacy levels and more positive trade-offs than a naive distribution of $\\varepsilon$. Our work highlights the intricacies of text privatization with DP, and furthermore, it calls for further work on finding more efficient ways to maximize the privatization benefits offered by DP in text rewriting.",

Traditional detection methods primarily focus on well-known impersonation patterns, leaving gaps in identifying more complex attacks. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance typosquatting detection. By training an LLM on character-level transformations and pattern-based heuristics rather than domain-specific data, a more adaptable and resilient detection mechanism develops. Experimental results indicate that the Phi-4 14B model outperformed other tested models when properly fine tuned achieving a 98% accuracy rate with only a few thousand training samples.

Mutes, on the other hand, are designed to prompt video-based LLMs to produce exceptionally brief captions, lacking descriptive detail.

We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits.

Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits.\n  Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order $2$) along with a few key technical lemmas for a \"mutual information\" for collision entropies.

Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong privacy guarantee, it requires substantially more resources than computing on plaintext, often leading to unacceptably large latencies in getting the results. HE accelerators have emerged to mitigate this latency issue, but with the high cost of ASICs. In this paper we show that HE primitives can be converted to AI operators and accelerated on existing ASIC AI accelerators, like TPUs, which are already widely deployed in the cloud. Adapting such accelerators for HE requires (1) supporting modular multiplication, (2) high-precision arithmetic in software, and (3) efficient mapping on matrix engines. We introduce the CROSS compiler (1) to adopt Barrett reduction to provide modular reduction support using multiplier and adder, (2) Basis Aligned Transformation (BAT) to convert high-precision multiplication as low-precision matrix-vector multiplication, (3) Matrix Aligned Transformation (MAT) to covert vectorized modular operation with reduction into matrix multiplication that can be efficiently processed on 2D spatial matrix engine.

The recent introduction of GPU TEEs by NVIDIA enables machine learning (ML) models to be trained without leaking model weights or data to the cloud provider. However, the potential performance implications of using GPU TEEs for ML training are not well characterized. In this work, we present an in-depth characterization study on performance overhead associated with running distributed data parallel (DDP) ML training with GPU Trusted Execution Environments (TEE).\n  Our study reveals the performance challenges in DDP training within GPU TEEs. DDP uses ring-all-reduce, a well-known approach, to aggregate gradients from multiple devices. Ring all-reduce consists of multiple scatter-reduce and all-gather operations. In GPU TEEs only the GPU package (GPU and HBM memory) is trusted. Hence, any data communicated outside the GPU packages must be encrypted and authenticated for confidentiality and integrity verification. Hence, each phase of the ring-all-reduce requires encryption and message authentication code (MAC) generation from the sender, and decryption and MAC authentication on the receiver. As the number of GPUs participating in DDP increases, the overhead of secure inter-GPU communication during ring-all-reduce grows proportionally. Additionally, larger models lead to more asynchronous all-reduce operations, exacerbating the communication cost. Our results show that with four GPU TEEs, depending on the model that is being trained, the runtime per training iteration increases by an average of 8x and up to a maximum of 41.6x compared to DDP training without TEE.",

The multi-variate function MaxPool is widely adopted yet challenging to verify. In this paper, we present Ti-Lin, a robustness verifier for MaxPool-based CNNs with Tight Linear Approximation. Following the sequel of minimizing the over-approximation zone of the non-linear function of CNNs, we are the first to propose the provably neuron-wise tightest linear bounds for the MaxPool function.

Each additional link in a software product's supply chain increases the risk of the injection of malicious behavior. To improve supply chain provenance, many cybersecurity frameworks, standards, and regulations recommend the use of software signing. However, recent surveys and measurement studies have found that the adoption rate and quality of software signatures are low. We lack in-depth industry perspectives on the challenges and practices of software signing.\n  To understand software signing in practice, we interviewed 18 experienced security practitioners across 13 organizations. We study the challenges that affect the effective implementation of software signing in practice. We also provide possible impacts of experienced software supply chain failures, security standards, and regulations on software signing adoption. To summarize our findings: (1) We present a refined model of the software supply chain factory model highlighting practitioner's signing practices; (2) We highlight the different challenges-technical, organizational, and human-that hamper software signing implementation; (3) We report that experts disagree on the importance of signing; and (4) We describe how internal and external events affect the adoption of software signing. Our work describes the considerations for adopting software signing as one aspect of the broader goal of improved software supply chain security.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2412.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Despite the impressive synthesis quality of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, their black-box deployment poses significant regulatory challenges: Malicious actors can fine-tune these models to generate illegal content, circumventing existing safeguards through parameter manipulation. Therefore, it is essential to verify the integrity of T2I diffusion models. To this end, considering the randomness within the outputs of generative models and the high costs in interacting with them, we discern model tampering via the KL divergence between the distributions of the features of generated images. We propose a novel prompt selection algorithm based on learning automaton (PromptLA) for efficient and accurate verification. Evaluations on four advanced T2I models (e.g., SDXL, FLUX.1) demonstrate that our method achieves a mean AUC of over 0.96 in integrity detection, exceeding baselines by more than 0.2, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalization. Additionally, our approach achieves lower cost and is robust against image-level post-processing. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work addressing the integrity verification of T2I diffusion models, which establishes quantifiable standards for AI copyright litigation in practice.",
