However, quantum computers will be able to break these systems using Shor's Algorithm, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant alternatives. We first examine the McEliece cryptosystem, a code-based scheme believed to be secure against quantum attacks due to the hardness of decoding arbitrary linear codes. We then explore NTRU, a lattice-based system grounded in the difficulty of solving the Shortest Vector Problem. Finally, we establish connections between the structural foundations and security of the two systems.",

Ensuring their security is paramount to safeguard both individual users and the industries that depend on these networks. An essential condition for maintaining and improving the security posture of a system is the ability to effectively measure and monitor its security state. In this work we address the need for an objective measurement of the security state of 5G and future networks. We introduce a state machine model designed to capture the security life cycle of network functions and the transitions between different states within the life cycle. Such a model can be computed locally at each node, or hierarchically, by aggregating measurements into security domains or the whole network. We identify three essential security metrics -- attack surface exposure, impact of system vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of applied security controls -- that collectively form the basis for calculating the overall security score. With this approach, it is possible to provide a holistic understanding of the security posture, laying the foundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks. Through practical examples, we illustrate the real-world application of our proposed methodology, offering valuable insights for developing risk management and informed decision-making strategies in 5G and 6G security operations and laying the foundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks.",

However, such models have the ability to generate images containing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as pornography, violence, political content, and discrimination. To mitigate the risk of generating NSFW content, refusal mechanisms, i.e., safety checkers, have been developed to check potential NSFW content. Adversarial prompting techniques have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the refusal mechanisms. The key challenge remains to subtly modify the prompt in a way that preserves its sensitive nature while bypassing the refusal mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce TokenProber, a method designed for sensitivity-aware differential testing, aimed at evaluating the robustness of the refusal mechanisms in T2I models by generating adversarial prompts. Our approach is based on the key observation that adversarial prompts often succeed by exploiting discrepancies in how T2I models and safety checkers interpret sensitive content. Thus, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of the impact of specific words within prompts, distinguishing between dirty words that are essential for NSFW content generation and discrepant words that highlight the different sensitivity assessments between T2I models and safety checkers. Through the sensitivity-aware mutation, TokenProber generates adversarial prompts, striking a balance between maintaining NSFW content generation and evading detection. Our evaluation of TokenProber against 5 safety checkers on 3 popular T2I models, using 324 NSFW prompts, demonstrates its superior effectiveness in bypassing safety filters compared to existing methods (e.g., 54%+ increase on average), highlighting TokenProber's ability to uncover robustness issues in the existing refusal mechanisms.",

Existing backdoor formulations mainly address single-attack scenarios and are limited to Gaussian noise input models. To fill this gap, we propose MixBridge, a novel diffusion Schr\\\"odinger bridge (DSB) framework to cater to arbitrary input distributions (taking I2I tasks as special cases). Beyond this trait, we demonstrate that backdoor triggers can be injected into MixBridge by directly training with poisoned image pairs. This eliminates the need for the cumbersome modifications to stochastic differential equations required in previous studies, providing a flexible tool to study backdoor behavior for bridge models. However, a key question arises: can a single DSB model train multiple backdoor triggers? Unfortunately, our theory shows that when attempting this, the model ends up following the geometric mean of benign and backdoored distributions, leading to performance conflict across backdoor tasks. To overcome this, we propose a Divide-and-Merge strategy to mix different bridges, where models are independently pre-trained for each specific objective (Divide) and then integrated into a unified model (Merge). In addition, a Weight Reallocation Scheme (WRS) is also designed to enhance the stealthiness of MixBridge. Empirical studies across diverse generation tasks speak to the efficacy of MixBridge.",

This study introduces a robust and scalable framework to detect DDoS attacks in highway-based VANET environments. A synthetic dataset was constructed using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) in conjunction with the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and further enriched with real-world mobility traces from Germany's A81 highway, extracted via OpenStreetMap (OSM). Three traffic categories were simulated: DDoS, VoIP, and TCP-based video streaming (VideoTCP). The data preprocessing pipeline included normalization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature engineering, missing value imputation, and class balancing using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Eleven classifiers were benchmarked, among them XGBoost (XGB), CatBoost (CB), AdaBoost (AB), GradientBoosting (GB), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). XGB and CB achieved the best performance, each attaining an F1-score of 96%.

Machine Learning-based IDS that learn from the network traffic characteristics and can discern attack patterns from benign traffic offer an advanced solution to traditional signature-based IDS. However, they heavily rely on labeled datasets, and their ability to generalize when encountering unseen traffic patterns remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised contrastive learning approach based on transformer encoders, specifically tailored for generalizable intrusion detection on raw packet sequences. Our proposed learning scheme employs a packet-level data augmentation strategy combined with a transformer-based architecture to extract and generate meaningful representations of traffic flows. Unlike traditional methods reliant on handcrafted statistical features (NetFlow), our approach automatically learns comprehensive packet sequence representations, significantly enhancing performance in anomaly identification tasks and supervised learning for intrusion detection. Our transformer-based framework exhibits better performance in comparison to existing NetFlow self-supervised methods. Specifically, we achieve up to a 3% higher AUC in anomaly detection for intra-dataset evaluation and up to 20% higher AUC scores in inter-dataset evaluation. Moreover, our model provides a strong baseline for supervised intrusion detection with limited labeled data, exhibiting an improvement over self-supervised NetFlow models of up to 1.5% AUC when pretrained and evaluated on the same dataset. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our pretrained model when fine-tuned across different datasets, demonstrating strong performance even when lacking benign data from the target domain.",

However, these systems have inherent artificial intelligence security vulnerabilities, which are exploited via adversarial patch attacks, particularly in physical environments. This study demonstrated that adversarial patches can severely disrupt object detection models used in unmanned stores, leading to issues such as theft, inventory discrepancies, and interference. We investigated three types of adversarial patch attacks -- Hiding, Creating, and Altering attacks -- and highlighted their effectiveness. We also introduce the novel color histogram similarity loss function by leveraging attacker knowledge of the color information of a target class object. Besides the traditional confusion-matrix-based attack success rate, we introduce a new bounding-boxes-based metric to analyze the practical impact of these attacks. Starting with attacks on object detection models trained on snack and fruit datasets in a digital environment, we evaluated the effectiveness of adversarial patches in a physical testbed that mimicked a real unmanned store with RGB cameras and realistic conditions. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these attacks in black-box scenarios, demonstrating that shadow attacks can enhance success rates of attacks even without direct access to model parameters. Our study underscores the necessity for robust defense strategies to protect unmanned stores from adversarial threats. Highlighting the limitations of the current defense mechanisms in real-time detection systems and discussing various proactive measures, we provide insights into improving the robustness of object detection models and fortifying unmanned retail environments against these attacks.",

Experimental results demonstrate that our adaptive RL based framework significantly outperforms static policies, achieving higher intrusion detection rates (92% compared to 82% for static policies) and substantially reducing incident detection and response times by 58%. In addition, it maintains high conformity with security requirements and efficient resource usage.

This paper reviews the application of Bayesian Networks (BNs) in cybersecurity risk modeling, highlighting their capacity to represent probabilistic dependencies, integrate diverse threat indicators, and support reasoning under uncertainty. A structured case study is presented in which a STRIDE-based attack tree for an automotive In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system is transformed into a Bayesian Network. Logical relationships are encoded using Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs), and threat likelihoods are derived from normalized DREAD scores. The model enables not only probabilistic inference of system compromise likelihood but also supports causal analysis using do-calculus and local sensitivity analysis to identify high-impact vulnerabilities. These analyses provide insight into the most influential nodes within the threat propagation chain, informing targeted mitigation strategies. While demonstrating the potential of BNs for dynamic and context-aware risk assessment, the study also outlines limitations related to scalability, reliance on expert input, static structure assumptions, and limited temporal modeling. The paper concludes by advocating for future enhancements through Dynamic Bayesian Networks, structure learning, and adaptive inference to better support real-time cybersecurity decision-making in complex environments.",

However, the decentralized nature of FL introduces vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients manipulate their local models to disrupt the training process. While Byzantine-robust aggregation rules have been developed to mitigate such attacks, they remain inadequate against more advanced threats. In response, recent advancements have focused on FL detection techniques to identify potentially malicious participants. Unfortunately, these methods often misclassify numerous benign clients as threats or rely on unrealistic assumptions about the server's capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, SafeFL, specifically designed to accurately identify malicious clients in FL. The SafeFL approach involves the server collecting a series of global models to generate a synthetic dataset, which is then used to distinguish between malicious and benign models based on their behavior. Extensive testing demonstrates that SafeFL outperforms existing methods, offering superior efficiency and accuracy in detecting malicious clients.",

The proposed type system allows the specification of security policies in terms of input and output packet bit fields rather than program variables. We formalize this type system and prove it sound, guaranteeing that well-typed programs satisfy noninterference.

Existing methods primarily focus on performance metrics using data-driven approaches, often neglecting mechanisms to ensure faithful adherence to the official standard. This deficiency compromises reliability and consistency of TTP assignments, creating intelligence silos and contradictory threat assessments across organizations. To address this, we introduce a novel framework that converts abstract standard definitions into actionable, contextualized knowledge. Our method utilizes Large Language Model (LLM) to generate, update, and apply this knowledge. This framework populates an evolvable memory with dual-layer situational knowledge instances derived from labeled examples and official definitions. The first layer identifies situational contexts (e.g., \"Communication with C2 using encoded subdomains\"), while the second layer captures distinctive features that differentiate similar techniques (e.g., distinguishing T1132 \"Data Encoding\" from T1071 \"Application Layer Protocol\" based on whether the focus is on encoding methods or protocol usage). This structured approach provides a transparent basis for explainable TTP assignments and enhanced human oversight, while also helping to standardize other TTP extraction systems. Experiments show our framework (using Qwen2.5-32B) boosts Technique F1 scores by 11\\% over GPT-4o.

However, systems that require verification or monitoring by a third party to ensure compliance with a specification might contain sensitive information, causing privacy concerns when usual runtime verification approaches are used. Privacy is compromised if protected information about the system, or sensitive data that is processed by the system, is revealed. In addition, revealing the specification being monitored may undermine the essence of third-party verification.\n  In this work, we propose two novel protocols for the privacy-preserving runtime verification of systems against formal sequential specifications. In our first protocol, the monitor verifies whether the system satisfies the specification without learning anything else, though both parties are aware of the specification. Our second protocol ensures that the system remains oblivious to the monitored specification, while the monitor learns only whether the system satisfies the specification and nothing more. Our protocols adapt and improve existing techniques used in cryptography, and more specifically, multi-party computation.\n  The sequential specification defines the observation step of the monitor, whose granularity depends on the situation (e.g., banks may be monitored on a daily basis). Our protocols exchange a single message per observation step, after an initialisation phase. This design minimises communication overhead, enabling relatively lightweight privacy-preserving monitoring. We implement our approach for monitoring specifications described by register automata and evaluate it experimentally.",

However, ML-based detectors are vulnerable to evasion attacks, where small, crafted changes bypass detection. Despite progress in adversarial defenses, the lack of comprehensive evaluation frameworks in binary-constrained domains limits understanding of their robustness. We introduce two key contributions. First, Prioritized Binary Rounding, a technique to convert continuous perturbations into binary feature spaces while preserving high attack success and low perturbation size. Second, the sigma-binary attack, a novel adversarial method for binary domains, designed to achieve attack goals with minimal feature changes. Experiments on the Malscan dataset show that sigma-binary outperforms existing attacks and exposes key vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art defenses. Defenses equipped with adversary detectors, such as KDE, DLA, DNN+, and ICNN, exhibit significant brittleness, with attack success rates exceeding 90% using fewer than 10 feature modifications and reaching 100% with just 20. Adversarially trained defenses, including AT-rFGSM-k, AT-MaxMA, improves robustness under small budgets but remains vulnerable to unrestricted perturbations, with attack success rates of 99.45% and 96.62%, respectively. Although PAD-SMA demonstrates strong robustness against state-of-the-art gradient-based adversarial attacks by maintaining an attack success rate below 16.55%, the sigma-binary attack significantly outperforms these methods, achieving a 94.56% success rate under unrestricted perturbations. These findings highlight the critical need for precise method like sigma-binary to expose hidden vulnerabilities in existing defenses and support the development of more resilient malware detection systems.",

Many research works have designed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to identify attacks by training machine learning classifiers on bus traffic or its properties. Actions to take after detection are, on the other hand, less investigated, and prevention mechanisms usually include protocol modification (e.g., adding authentication). An effective solution has yet to be implemented on a large scale in the wild. The reasons are related to the effort to handle sporadic false positives, the inevitable delay introduced by authentication, and the closed-source automobile environment that does not easily permit modifying Electronic Control Units (ECUs) software.\n  In this paper, we propose CANTXSec, the first deterministic Intrusion Detection and Prevention system based on physical ECU activations. It employs a new classification of attacks based on the attacker's need in terms of access level to the bus, distinguishing between Frame Injection Attacks (FIAs) (i.e., using frame-level access) and Single-Bit Attacks (SBAs) (i.e., employing bit-level access). CANTXSec detects and prevents classical attacks in the CAN bus, while detecting advanced attacks that have been less investigated in the literature. We prove the effectiveness of our solution on a physical testbed, where we achieve 100% detection accuracy in both classes of attacks while preventing 100% of FIAs. Moreover, to encourage developers to employ CANTXSec, we discuss implementation details, providing an analysis based on each user's risk assessment.",

Privacy issues are generally highly prevalent in mobile applications, particularly targeting the Android platform, the most popular mobile operating system. For this reason, several techniques have been proposed to identify malicious behavior in Android applications, including the Mining Android Sandbox approach (MAS approach), which aims to identify malicious behavior in repackaged Android applications (apps). However, previous empirical studies evaluated the MAS approach using a small dataset consisting of only 102 pairs of original and repackaged apps. This limitation raises questions about the external validity of their findings and whether the MAS approach can be generalized to larger datasets. To address these concerns, this paper presents the results of a replication study focused on evaluating the performance of the MAS approach regarding its capabilities of correctly classifying malware from different families. Unlike previous studies, our research employs a dataset that is an order of magnitude larger, comprising 4,076 pairs of apps covering a more diverse range of Android malware families. Surprisingly, our findings indicate a poor performance of the MAS approach for identifying malware, with the F1-score decreasing from 0.90 for the small dataset used in the previous studies to 0.54 in our more extensive dataset. Upon closer examination, we discovered that certain malware families partially account for the low accuracy of the MAS approach, which fails to classify a repackaged version of an app as malware correctly. Our findings highlight the limitations of the MAS approach, particularly when scaled, and underscore the importance of complementing it with other techniques to detect a broader range of malware effectively.",

However, we argue that this assumption is too restrictive since social networks do not originate from the SBM. Thus, we delve into an analysis for general graphs in this work. Our primary focus is the edge flipping method -- a common technique for protecting local differential privacy. We show that, when the edges of an $n$-vertex graph satisfying some reasonable well-clustering assumptions are flipped with a probability of $O(\\log n/n)$, the clustering outcomes are largely consistent. Empirical tests further corroborate these theoretical findings. Conversely, although clustering outcomes have been stable for non-sparse and well-clustered graphs produced from the SBM, we show that in general, spectral clustering may yield highly erratic results on certain well-clustered graphs when the flipping probability is $\\omega(\\log n/n)$.

First, we introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,800 jailbreak attempts spanning 35 diverse attack methods. Leveraging this dataset, we train probes to classify successful from unsuccessful jailbreaks using the latent representations corresponding to prompt tokens. Notably, we find that even when probes achieve high accuracy in predicting the success of jailbreaks, their performance often fails to generalize to unseen attack methods. This reveals that different jailbreaking strategies exploit different non-linear, non-universal features. Next, we demonstrate that non-linear probes provide a powerful tool for steering model behavior. Specifically, we use these probes to guide targeted latent space perturbations, enabling us to effectively modulate the model's robustness against jailbreaks.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising avenue for automating these processes, enhancing both efficiency and efficacy.

This article shifts the research focus from traditional password encryption to the establishment of gatekeeping mechanisms for effective interactions between a system and the outside world. Here, we propose a triple-identity authentication system to achieve this goal. Specifically, this local system opens the inner structure of its hash algorithm to all user credentials, including the login name, login password, and authentication password. When a login credential is entered, the local system hashes it and then creates a unique identifier using intermediate hash elements randomly selected from the open algorithm. Importantly, this locally generated unique identifier (rather than the stored hash produced by the open algorithm) is utilized to verify the user's combined identity, which is generated by combining the entered credential with the International Mobile Equipment Identity and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity. The verification process is implemented at each interaction point: the login name field, the login password field, and the server's authentication point. Thus, within the context of this triple-identity authentication system, we establish a robust gatekeeping mechanism for system interactions, ultimately providing a level of security that is equivalent to multi-factor authentication.",

However, the security of local LLMs through the lens of hardware cache side-channels remains unexplored. In this paper, we unveil novel side-channel vulnerabilities in local LLM inference: token value and token position leakage, which can expose both the victim's input and output text, thereby compromising user privacy. Specifically, we found that adversaries can infer the token values from the cache access patterns of the token embedding operation, and deduce the token positions from the timing of autoregressive decoding phases. To demonstrate the potential of these leaks, we design a novel eavesdropping attack framework targeting both open-source and proprietary LLM inference systems. The attack framework does not directly interact with the victim's LLM and can be executed without privilege.\n  We evaluate the attack on a range of practical local LLM deployments (e.g., Llama, Falcon, and Gemma), and the results show that our attack achieves promising accuracy. The restored output and input text have an average edit distance of 5.2% and 17.3% to the ground truth, respectively. Furthermore, the reconstructed texts achieve average cosine similarity scores of 98.7% (input) and 98.0% (output).",

By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers compromise the integrity and resilience of modern digital ecosystems. To address this risk, security experts actively employ Machine Learning or Deep Learning-based strategies, integrating static, dynamic, or hybrid approaches to categorize malware instances. Despite their advantages, these methods have inherent drawbacks and malware variants persistently evolve with increased sophistication, necessitating advancements in detection strategies. Visualization-based techniques are emerging as scalable and interpretable solutions for detecting and understanding malicious behaviors across diverse platforms including desktop, mobile, IoT, and distributed systems as well as through analysis of network packet capture files. In this comprehensive survey of more than 100 high-quality research articles, we evaluate existing visualization-based approaches applied to malware detection and classification. As a first contribution, we propose a new all-encompassing framework to study the landscape of visualization-based malware detection techniques. Within this framework, we systematically analyze state-of-the-art approaches across the critical stages of the malware detection pipeline. By analyzing not only the single techniques but also how they are combined to produce the final solution, we shed light on the main challenges in visualization-based approaches and provide insights into the advancements and potential future directions in this critical field.",

Additionally, a secure ranging strategy is designed for backward compatibility with existing standards such as IEEE 802.15.4a/z, combined with an attack detection scheme. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results in the case of the Ghost Peak attack, as demonstrated by Patrick Leu et al. The random time-hopping mechanism is verified to be capable of reducing the success rate of distance reduction attacks to less than 0.01%, thereby significantly enhancing the security of UWB ranging.",

Approaches to the design of intrusion detection systems must evolve and go beyond the traditional concept of perimeter control to build on new paradigms that exploit the typical characteristics of future 5G and 6G networks, such as in-network computing and intelligent programmable data planes. The aim of this research is to propose a disruptive paradigm in which devices in a typical data plane of a future programmable network have anomaly detection capabilities and cooperate in a fully distributed fashion to act as an ML-enabled Intrusion Prevention System ``embedded\" into the network. The reported proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm allows working effectively and with a good level of precision while occupying overall less CPU and RAM resources of the devices involved.",
