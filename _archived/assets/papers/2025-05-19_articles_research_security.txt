This paper introduces the Agent Name Service (ANS), a novel architecture based on DNS addressing the lack of a public agent discovery framework. ANS provides a protocol-agnostic registry infrastructure that leverages Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificates for verifiable agent identity and trust. The architecture features several key innovations: a formalized agent registration and renewal mechanism for lifecycle management; DNS-inspired naming conventions with capability-aware resolution; a modular Protocol Adapter Layer supporting diverse communication standards (A2A, MCP, ACP etc.); and precisely defined algorithms for secure resolution. We implement structured communication using JSON Schema and conduct a comprehensive threat analysis of our proposal. The result is a foundational directory service addressing the core challenges of secured discovery and interaction in multi-agent systems, paving the way for future interoperable, trustworthy, and scalable agent ecosystems.",

In this paper, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the transpilation of C code to idiomatic Rust, while ensuring that the generated code mitigates any memory-related vulnerabilities present in the original code. To that end, we present the design and implementation of SafeTrans, a framework that uses LLMs to i) transpile C code into Rust and ii) iteratively fix any compilation and runtime errors in the resulting code. A key novelty of our approach is the introduction of a few-shot guided repair technique for translation errors, which provides contextual information and example code snippets for specific error types, guiding the LLM toward the correct solution. Another novel aspect of our work is the evaluation of the security implications of the transpilation process, i.e., whether potential vulnerabilities in the original C code have been properly addressed in the translated Rust code. We experimentally evaluated SafeTrans with six leading LLMs and a set of 2,653 C programs accompanied by comprehensive unit tests, which were used for validating the correctness of the translated code. Our results show that our iterative repair strategy improves the rate of successful translations from 54% to 80% for the best-performing LLM (GPT-4o), and that all types of identified vulnerabilities in the original C code are effectively mitigated in the translated Rust code.",

These findings validate the framework of using neural networks for feature exploration, providing researchers with novel insights that advance established cryptanalysis methods.\n  Neural networks have inspired the development of more precise integral search models. By comparing the integral distinguishers obtained via neural networks with those identified by classical methods, we observe that existing automated search models often fail to find optimal distinguishers. To address this issue, we develop a meet in the middle search framework that balances model accuracy and computational efficiency. As a result, we reduce the number of active plaintext bits required for an 11 rounds integral distinguisher on SKINNY64/64, and further identify a 12 rounds key dependent integral distinguisher achieving one additional round over the previous best-known result.\n  The integral distinguishers discovered by neural networks enable key recovery attacks on more rounds. We identify a 7 rounds key independent integral distinguisher from neural networks with even only one active plaintext cell, which is based on linear combinations of bits. This distinguisher enables a 15 rounds key recovery attack on SKINNYn/n, improving upon the previous record by one round.

Sub-optimal allocation can lead to either excessive noise, rendering the data useless, or to insufficient protections for sensitive information. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimal privacy budget allocation for hierarchical data release. It formulates this challenge as a constrained optimization problem, aiming to maximize data utility subject to a total privacy budget while considering the inherent trade-offs between data granularity and privacy loss.

However, it is vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) such as \"LoKI\" and \"Robbing the Fed\", where malicious models sent from the server to the client can reconstruct sensitive user data. To counter this, we introduce DRArmor, a novel defense mechanism that integrates Explainable AI with targeted detection and mitigation strategies for DRA. Unlike existing defenses that focus on the entire model, DRArmor identifies and addresses the root cause (i.e., malicious layers within the model that send gradients with malicious intent) by analyzing their contribution to the output and detecting inconsistencies in gradient values. Once these malicious layers are identified, DRArmor applies defense techniques such as noise injection, pixelation, and pruning to these layers rather than the whole model, minimizing the attack surface and preserving client data privacy. We evaluate DRArmor's performance against the advanced LoKI attack across diverse datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, in a 200-client FL setup. Our results demonstrate DRArmor's effectiveness in mitigating data leakage, achieving high True Positive and True Negative Rates of 0.910 and 0.890, respectively. Additionally, DRArmor maintains an average accuracy of 87%, effectively protecting client privacy without compromising model performance. Compared to existing defense mechanisms, DRArmor reduces the data leakage rate by 62.5% with datasets containing 500 samples per client.",

To maximize the benefits of competitive retail energy markets, group purchasing is an emerging paradigm that aggregates consumers' purchasing power by coordinating switch decisions to specific energy providers for discounted energy plans. Traditionally, group purchasing is mediated by a trusted third-party, which suffers from the lack of privacy and transparency. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of decentralized privacy-preserving group purchasing, empowered by privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation, to enable users to form a coalition for coordinated switch decisions in a decentralized manner, without a trusted third-party. The coordinated switch decisions are determined by a competitive online algorithm, based on users' private consumption data and current energy plan tariffs. Remarkably, no private user consumption data will be revealed to others in the online decision-making process, which is carried out in a transparently verifiable manner to eliminate frauds from dishonest users and supports fair mutual compensations by sharing the switching costs to incentivize group purchasing.

However, we uncover a significant privacy vulnerability: when gradient differences are used as PoFU, honest-but-curious auditors may exploit mathematical correlations between gradient differences and forgotten samples to reconstruct the latter. Such reconstruction, if feasible, would face three key challenges: (i) restricted auditor access to client-side data, (ii) limited samples derivable from individual PoFU, and (iii) high-dimensional redundancy in gradient differences. To overcome these challenges, we propose Inverting Gradient difference to Forgotten data (IGF), a novel learning-based reconstruction attack framework that employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. IGF incorporates a tailored pixel-level inversion model optimized via a composite loss that captures both structural and semantic cues. This enables efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction of large-scale samples, surpassing existing methods. To counter this novel attack, we design an orthogonal obfuscation defense that preserves PoFU verification utility while preventing sensitive forgotten data reconstruction.

However, as the MCP is increasingly adopted, third-party customized versions of the MCP server expose potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat, which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct Preference Manipulation Attack ($\\mathtt{DPMA}$) that achieves significant effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and lacks stealthiness.

Instead of attacking the most commonly used software and monetizing exploits by targeting the lowest common denominator among victims, LLMs enable adversaries to launch tailored attacks on a user-by-user basis. On the exploitation front, instead of human attackers manually searching for one difficult-to-identify bug in a product with millions of users, LLMs can find thousands of easy-to-identify bugs in products with thousands of users. And on the monetization front, instead of generic ransomware that always performs the same attack (encrypt all your data and request payment to decrypt), an LLM-driven ransomware attack could tailor the ransom demand based on the particular content of each exploited device.\n  We show that these two attacks (and several others) are imminently practical using state-of-the-art LLMs. For example, we show that without any human intervention, an LLM finds highly sensitive personal information in the Enron email dataset (e.g., an executive having an affair with another employee) that could be used for blackmail.

A high rate of missed threats can be the result, as traditional machine learning models tend to struggle in identifying attacks when normal data volume is much higher than the volume of attacks. For example, the dataset used in this study reveals a strong class imbalance with 94,659 instances of the majority class and only 28 instances of the minority class, making it quite challenging to determine rare attacks accurately. The challenges presented in this research are addressed by hybrid sampling techniques designed to improve data imbalance detection accuracy in IoT domains.

The obtained results indicate that the Random Forest model achieved the best performance with a Kappa score of 0.9903, test accuracy of 0.9961, and AUC of 0.9994. Strong performance is also shown by the Soft Voting model, with an accuracy of 0.9952 and AUC of 0.9997, indicating the benefits of combining model predictions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of hybrid sampling combined with robust model and feature selection for significantly improving IoT security against cyber-attacks, especially in highly imbalanced data environments.",

The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral trajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can introduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may trigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address the safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we propose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing a lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely responsiveness.

The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aim to mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objective such as minimizing the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectives present when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time, or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defence game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining critical functionality of green-agents.

To date, the extent to which LLMs can autonomously execute multi-host network attacks} is not well understood. To this end, our first contribution is MHBench, an open-source multi-host attack benchmark with 10 realistic emulated networks (from 25 to 50 hosts). We find that popular LLMs including modern reasoning models (e.g., GPT4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking) with state-of-art security-relevant prompting strategies (e.g., PentestGPT, CyberSecEval3) cannot autonomously execute multi-host network attacks. To enable LLMs to autonomously execute such attacks, our second contribution is Incalmo, an high-level abstraction layer. Incalmo enables LLMs to specify high-level actions (e.g., infect a host, scan a network). Incalmo's translation layer converts these actions into lower-level primitives (e.g., commands to exploit tools) through expert agents. In 9 out of 10 networks in MHBench, LLMs using Incalmo achieve at least some of the attack goals. Even smaller LLMs (e.g., Haiku 3.5, Gemini 2 Flash) equipped with Incalmo achieve all goals in 5 of 10 environments.

SLH was, however, not strong enough for protecting non-cryptographic code, leading to the introduction of Ultimate SLH, which provides protection for arbitrary programs, but has too large overhead for general use, since it conservatively assumes that all data is secret. In this paper we introduce a flexible SLH notion that achieves the best of both worlds by generalizing both Selective and Ultimate SLH. We give a suitable security definition for such transformations protecting arbitrary programs: any transformed program running with speculation should not leak more than what the source program leaks sequentially. We formally prove using the Rocq prover that two flexible SLH variants enforce this relative security guarantee. As easy corollaries we also obtain that, in our setting, Ultimate SLH enforces our relative security notion, and two selective SLH variants enforce speculative constant-time security.",

It serves as a crucial technology for ensuring both privacy and integrity in outsourced computation, where a client sends input ciphertexts ct and a function f to a server and verifies the correctness of the evaluation upon receiving the evaluation result f(ct) from the server. At CCS, Chatel et al. introduced two lightweight VHE schemes: Replication Encoding (REP) and Polynomial Encoding (PE). A similar approach to REP was used by Albrecht et al. in Eurocrypt to develop a Verifiable Oblivious PRF scheme (vADDG). A key approach in these schemes is to embed specific secret information within HE ciphertexts to verify homomorphic evaluations. This paper presents efficient attacks that exploit the homomorphic properties of encryption schemes. The one strategy is to retrieve the secret information in encrypted state from the input ciphertexts and then leverage it to modify the resulting ciphertext without being detected by the verification algorithm. The other is to exploit the secret embedding structure to modify the evaluation function f into f' which works well on input values for verification purposes. Our forgery attack on vADDG demonstrates that the proposed 80-bit security parameters in fact offer less than 10-bits of concrete security.

As a consequence, researchers are increasingly turning to machine learning (ML) approaches to overcome these obstacles. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze ML-based NTC studies, developing a taxonomy of their design choices, benchmarking suites, and prevalent assumptions impacting classifier performance. Through this systematization, we demonstrate widespread reliance on outdated datasets, oversights in design choices, and the consequences of unsubstantiated assumptions. Our evaluation reveals that the majority of proposed encrypted traffic classifiers have mistakenly utilized unencrypted traffic due to the use of legacy datasets. Furthermore, by conducting 348 feature occlusion experiments on state-of-the-art classifiers, we show how oversights in NTC design choices lead to overfitting, and validate or refute prevailing assumptions with empirical evidence. By highlighting lessons learned, we offer strategic insights, identify emerging research directions, and recommend best practices to support the development of real-world applicable NTC methodologies.",

While these risks and their mitigation strategies have been extensively researched from a technical perspective, users' perceptions of these platforms' security and privacy remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale analysis of over 2.5M user posts from the r/ChatGPT Reddit community to understand users' security and privacy concerns and attitudes toward conversational AI platforms. Our qualitative analysis reveals that users are concerned about each stage of the data lifecycle (i.e., collection, usage, and retention). They seek mitigations for security vulnerabilities, compliance with privacy regulations, and greater transparency and control in data handling. We also find that users exhibit varied behaviors and preferences when interacting with these platforms. Some users proactively safeguard their data and adjust privacy settings, while others prioritize convenience over privacy risks, dismissing privacy concerns in favor of benefits, or feel resigned to inevitable data sharing. Through qualitative content and regression analysis, we discover that users' concerns evolve over time with the evolving AI landscape and are influenced by technological developments and major events. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for users, platforms, enterprises, and policymakers to enhance transparency, improve data controls, and increase user trust and adoption.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.11358v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where an attacker injects prompts into their inputs to induce attacker-desired outputs. A detection method aims to determine whether a given input is contaminated by an injected prompt. However, existing detection methods have limited effectiveness against state-of-the-art attacks, let alone adaptive ones. In this work, we propose DataSentinel, a game-theoretic method to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, DataSentinel fine-tunes an LLM to detect inputs contaminated with injected prompts that are strategically adapted to evade detection. We formulate this as a minimax optimization problem, with the objective of fine-tuning the LLM to detect strong adaptive attacks. Furthermore, we propose a gradient-based method to solve the minimax optimization problem by alternating between the inner max and outer min problems. Our evaluation results on multiple benchmark datasets and LLMs show that DataSentinel effectively detects both existing and adaptive prompt injection attacks.",

However, the surges waned quickly after a few weeks, with patterns resembling those observed in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The scale of attacks and discussions within the hacking community this time was both significantly lower than those during the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war, and attacks have been prominently one-sided: many pro-Palestinian supporters have targeted Israel, while attacks on Palestine have been much less significant. Beyond targeting these two, attackers also defaced sites of other countries to express their war support. Their broader opinions are also largely disparate, with far more support for Palestine and many objections expressed toward Israel.",

Beyond multiple-choice questions, DMind Benchmark features domain-specific tasks such as contract debugging and on-chain numeric reasoning, mirroring real-world scenarios. We evaluated 26 models, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and Qwen, uncovering notable performance gaps in specialized areas like token economics and security-critical contract analysis.

While previous benchmarks have focused on security evaluations with limited and predefined attack domains, such as cybersecurity attacks, they often lack a comprehensive assessment of intent-driven adversarial prompts and the consideration of real-life scenario-based multi-turn attacks. To address this gap, we present SecReEvalBench, the Security Resilience Evaluation Benchmark, which defines four novel metrics: Prompt Attack Resilience Score, Prompt Attack Refusal Logic Score, Chain-Based Attack Resilience Score and Chain-Based Attack Rejection Time Score. Moreover, SecReEvalBench employs six questioning sequences for model assessment: one-off attack, successive attack, successive reverse attack, alternative attack, sequential ascending attack with escalating threat levels and sequential descending attack with diminishing threat levels. In addition, we introduce a dataset customized for the benchmark, which incorporates both neutral and malicious prompts, categorised across seven security domains and sixteen attack techniques. In applying this benchmark, we systematically evaluate five state-of-the-art open-weighted large language models, Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, Mistral v0.3, DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen 3. Our findings offer critical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of modern large language models in defending against evolving adversarial threats.

Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards. Our code is availble at https://github.com/redwyd/PrivacyJailbreak.",

We present PRACLeak, a novel attack that exploits these timing differences to leak sensitive information, such as secret keys from vulnerable AES implementations, by monitoring memory access latencies.\n  To counter this, we propose Timing-Safe PRAC (TPRAC), a defense that eliminates PRAC-induced timing channels without compromising RH mitigation efficacy. TPRAC uses Timing-Based RFMs, issued periodically and independent of memory activity. It requires only a single-entry in-DRAM mitigation queue per DRAM bank and is compatible with existing DRAM standards. Our evaluations demonstrate that TPRAC closes timing channels while incurring only 3.4% performance overhead at the RH threshold of 1024.",

In this work, we probe the effectiveness of different fine-tuning and input sanitization approaches on mitigating MSJ attacks, alone and in combination. We find incremental mitigation effectiveness for each, and show that the combined techniques significantly reduce the effectiveness of MSJ attacks, while retaining model performance in benign in-context learning and conversational tasks. We suggest that our approach could meaningfully ameliorate this vulnerability if incorporated into model safety post-training.",

Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
