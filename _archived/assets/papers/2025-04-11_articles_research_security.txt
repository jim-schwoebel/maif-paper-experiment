        "summary": "arXiv:2504.07132v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Rug pulls in Solana have caused significant damage to users interacting with Decentralized Finance (DeFi). A rug pull occurs when developers exploit users' trust and drain liquidity from token pools on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), leaving users with worthless tokens. Although rug pulls in Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have gained attention recently, analysis of rug pulls in Solana remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we introduce SolRPDS (Solana Rug Pull Dataset), the first public rug pull dataset derived from Solana's transactions. We examine approximately four years of DeFi data (2021-2024) that covers suspected and confirmed tokens exhibiting rug pull patterns. The dataset, derived from 3.69 billion transactions, consists of 62,895 suspicious liquidity pools. The data is annotated for inactivity states, which is a key indicator, and includes several detailed liquidity activities such as additions, removals, and last interaction as well as other attributes such as inactivity periods and withdrawn token amounts, to help identify suspicious behavior. Our preliminary analysis reveals clear distinctions between legitimate and fraudulent liquidity pools and we found that 22,195 tokens in the dataset exhibit rug pull patterns during the examined period. SolRPDS can support a wide range of future research on rug pulls including the development of data-driven and heuristic-based solutions for real-time rug pull detection and mitigation.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.07135v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the era of rapidly evolving large language models (LLMs), state-of-the-art rumor detection systems, particularly those based on Message Propagation Trees (MPTs), which represent a conversation tree with the post as its root and the replies as its descendants, are facing increasing threats from adversarial attacks that leverage LLMs to generate and inject malicious messages. Existing methods are based on the assumption that different nodes exhibit varying degrees of influence on predictions. They define nodes with high predictive influence as important nodes and target them for attacks. If the model treats nodes' predictive influence more uniformly, attackers will find it harder to target high predictive influence nodes. In this paper, we propose Similarizing the predictive Influence of Nodes with Contrastive Learning (SINCon), a defense mechanism that encourages the model to learn graph representations where nodes with varying importance have a more uniform influence on predictions. Extensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets demonstrate that SINCon not only preserves high classification accuracy on clean data but also significantly enhances resistance against LLM-driven message injection attacks.",

Encryption of RTF-8 data is realized by dynamically generating decimal numbers that lead to the encryption and decryption of alphabetic strings in integer representation by simple addition rules, the modulus of the dimension of the considered alphabet. The binary numbers for the private dynamical keys correlate with the binary numbers of public reference keys from a mapping defined by the specific GAN configuration. For reversible encryption with bijective mapping between dynamic and reference keys as defined by the GAN encryptor with random combinations of NOT logical gates between bitwise subcomponents of the transmitted text signal, secure text encryption can be realized by transferring a GAN-encrypted public key with encrypted text from a sender to a receiver. Using the technique described above, secure text mail transfer can be realized from component-wise encryption of text mail strings with total key sizes of up to $10^{8}$ bits that define random decimal numbers obtained from the GAN. From the present model, we assert that encrypted texts can be transmitted more efficiently and securely than from RSA encryption, as long as users of the specific configuration of the GAN encryption model are unaware of the GAN encryptor circuit.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.07362v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The shuffle model of DP (Differential Privacy) provides high utility by introducing a shuffler that randomly shuffles noisy data sent from users. However, recent studies show that existing shuffle protocols suffer from the following two major drawbacks. First, they are vulnerable to local data poisoning attacks, which manipulate the statistics about input data by sending crafted data, especially when the privacy budget epsilon is small. Second, the actual value of epsilon is increased by collusion attacks by the data collector and users.\n  In this paper, we address these two issues by thoroughly exploring the potential of the augmented shuffle model, which allows the shuffler to perform additional operations, such as random sampling and dummy data addition. Specifically, we propose a generalized framework for local-noise-free protocols in which users send (encrypted) input data to the shuffler without adding noise. We show that this generalized protocol provides DP and is robust to the above two attacks if a simpler mechanism that performs the same process on binary input data provides DP. Based on this framework, we propose three concrete protocols providing DP and robustness against the two attacks. Our first protocol generates the number of dummy values for each item from a binomial distribution and provides higher utility than several state-of-the-art existing shuffle protocols. Our second protocol significantly improves the utility of our first protocol by introducing a novel dummy-count distribution: asymmetric two-sided geometric distribution. Our third protocol is a special case of our second protocol and provides pure epsilon-DP. We show the effectiveness of our protocols through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments.",

We identify the optimal decomposition within the general clone paradigm. Moreover, we develop a simple and efficient algorithm to compute the exact value of the optimal privacy amplification bounds via Fast Fourier Transform. Experimental results demonstrate that the computed upper bounds for privacy amplification closely approximate the lower bounds, highlighting the tightness of our approach.

Various defenses have been developed to mitigate these attacks; however, they have two critical limitations: (i) significant network overhead during obfuscation and (ii) a lack of dynamic obfuscation for egress segments, exposing traffic patterns to adversaries. In response, we introduce MUFFLER, a novel connection-level traffic obfuscation system designed to secure Tor egress traffic. It dynamically maps real connections to a distinct set of virtual connections between the final Tor nodes and targeted services, either public or hidden. This approach creates egress traffic patterns fundamentally different from those at ingress segments without adding intentional padding bytes or timing delays. The mapping of real and virtual connections is adjusted in real-time based on ongoing network conditions, thwarting adversaries' efforts to detect egress traffic patterns. Extensive evaluations show that MUFFLER mitigates powerful correlation attacks with a TPR of 1% at an FPR of 10^-2 while imposing only a 2.17% bandwidth overhead. Moreover, it achieves up to 27x lower latency overhead than existing solutions and seamlessly integrates with the current Tor architecture.",

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.07578v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Clustering is a fundamental data processing task used for grouping records based on one or more features. In the vertically partitioned setting, data is distributed among entities, with each holding only a subset of those features. A key challenge in this scenario is that computing distances between records requires access to all distributed features, which may be privacy-sensitive and cannot be directly shared with other parties. The goal is to compute the joint clusters while preserving the privacy of each entity's dataset. Existing solutions using secret sharing or garbled circuits implement privacy-preserving variants of Lloyd's algorithm but incur high communication costs, scaling as O(nkt), where n is the number of data points, k the number of clusters, and t the number of rounds. These methods become impractical for large datasets or several parties, limiting their use to LAN settings only. On the other hand, a different line of solutions rely on differential privacy (DP) to outsource the local features of the parties to a central server. However, they often significantly degrade the utility of the clustering outcome due to excessive noise. In this work, we propose a novel solution based on homomorphic encryption and DP, reducing communication complexity to O(n+kt). In our method, parties securely outsource their features once, allowing a computing party to perform clustering operations under encryption. DP is applied only to the clusters' centroids, ensuring privacy with minimal impact on utility. Our solution clusters 100,000 two-dimensional points into five clusters using only 73MB of communication, compared to 101GB for existing works, and completes in just under 3 minutes on a 100Mbps network, whereas existing works take over 1 day.

        "summary": "arXiv:2504.07717v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical sciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.",

We examine this question through the lens of incentives. We argue that the challenge around better quality software is due in no small part to a sequence of misaligned incentives, the most critical of which being that the harm caused by software problems is by and large shouldered by consumers, not developers. This lack of liability means software vendors have every incentive to rush low-quality software onto the market and no incentive to enhance quality control. Within this context, this paper outlines a holistic technical and policy framework we believe is needed to incentivize better and more secure software development. At the heart of the incentive realignment is the concept of software liability. This framework touches on various components, including legal, technical, and financial, that are needed for software liability to work in practice; some currently exist, some will need to be re-imagined or established. This is primarily a market-driven approach that emphasizes voluntary participation but highlights the role appropriate regulation can play. We connect and contrast this with the EU legal environment and discuss what this framework means for open-source software (OSS) development and emerging AI risks. Moreover, we present a CrowdStrike case study complete with a what-if analysis had our proposed framework been in effect. Our intention is very much to stimulate a robust conversation among both researchers and practitioners.",

SAFARI's design emphasises scalability, air-gapped security, and automation, democratising access to safe ransomware investigation tools and fostering collaborative efforts. SAFARI leverages virtualisation, Infrastructure-as-Code, and OS-agnostic task automation to create isolated environments for controlled ransomware execution and analysis. The framework enables researchers to profile ransomware behaviour and evaluate mitigation strategies through automated, reproducible experiments. We demonstrate SAFARI's capabilities by building a proof-of-concept implementation and using it to run two case studies. The first analyses five renowned ransomware strains (including WannaCry and LockBit) to identify their encryption patterns and file targeting strategies. The second evaluates Ranflood, a contrast tool which we use against three dangerous strains.

In particular, no publicly available data from real ID documents exists, and most studies rely on proprietary in-house databases that are not available due to privacy reasons. In order to shed some light on this critical challenge that makes difficult to advance in the field, we explore a trade-off between privacy (i.e., amount of sensitive data available) and performance, proposing a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-preserving fake ID detection. Our proposed approach explores how privacy can be enhanced through: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID document (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. Also, state-of-the-art methods such as Vision Transformers and Foundation Models are considered in the analysis. The experimental framework shows that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at patch and ID document level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to this exploration, another key contribution of our study is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from both real and fake ID documents, along with the experimental framework and models, which will be available in our GitHub.",

Various quantum computers are accessible today via pay-as-you-go cloud computing models, offering unprecedented convenience. Due to its rapidly growing demand, quantum computers are shifting from a single-tenant to a multi-tenant model to enhance resource utilization. However, this widespread accessibility to shared multi-tenant systems also introduces potential security vulnerabilities. In this work, we present for the first time a set of novel attacks, named together as the QubitHammer attacks, which target state-of-the-art superconducting quantum computers. We show that in a multi-tenant cloud-based quantum system, an adversary with the basic capability to deploy custom pulses, similar to any standard user today, can utilize the QubitHammer attacks to significantly degrade the fidelity of victim circuits located on the same quantum computer. Upon extensive evaluation, the QubitHammer attacks achieve a very high variational distance of up to 0.938 from the expected outcome, thus demonstrating their potential to degrade victim computation. Our findings exhibit the effectiveness of these attacks across various superconducting quantum computers from a leading vendor, suggesting that QubitHammer represents a new class of security attacks. Further, the attacks are demonstrated to bypass all existing defenses proposed so far for ensuring the reliability in multi-tenant superconducting quantum computers.",

However, it also introduces new types of vulnerabilities. An example of such vulnerabilities is a composability bug between token contracts and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) that follows the Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM) model. This type of bug, which we refer to as CPMM composability bug, originates from issues in token contracts that make them incompatible with CPMMs, thereby endangering other tokens within the CPMM ecosystem. Since 2022, 23 exploits of such kind have resulted in a total loss of 2.2M USD. BlockSec, a smart contract auditing company, reported that 138 exploits of such kind occurred just in February 2023.\n  In this paper, we propose CPMMX , a tool that automatically detects CPMM composability bugs across entire blockchains. To achieve such scalability, we first formalized CPMM composability bugs and found that these bugs can be induced by breaking two safety invariants. Based on this finding, we designed CPMMX equipped with a two-step approach, called shallow-then-deep search. In more detail, it first uses shallow search to find transactions that break the invariants. Then, it uses deep search to refine these transactions, making them profitable for the attacker. We evaluated CPMMX against five baselines on two public datasets and one synthetic dataset. In our evaluation, CPMMX detected 2.5x to 1.5x more vulnerabilities compared to baseline methods. It also analyzed contracts significantly faster, achieving higher F1 scores than the baselines. Additionally, we applied CPMMX to all contracts on the latest blocks of the Ethereum and Binance networks and discovered 26 new exploits that can result in 15.7K USD profit in total.",

Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones, where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.",

However, malicious servers could deliberately manipulate the models to reconstruct clients' data from shared gradients, posing significant privacy risks. Although such active gradient leakage attacks (AGLAs) have been widely studied, they suffer from two severe limitations: (i) coverage: no existing AGLAs can reconstruct all samples in a batch from the shared gradients; (ii) stealthiness: no existing AGLAs can evade principled checks of clients. In this paper, we address these limitations with two core contributions. First, we introduce a new theoretical analysis approach, which uniformly models AGLAs as backdoor poisoning. This analysis approach reveals that the core principle of AGLAs is to bias the gradient space to prioritize the reconstruction of a small subset of samples while sacrificing the majority, which theoretically explains the above limitations of existing AGLAs. Second, we propose Enhanced Gradient Global Vulnerability (EGGV), the first AGLA that achieves complete attack coverage while evading client-side detection. In particular, EGGV employs a gradient projector and a jointly optimized discriminator to assess gradient vulnerability, steering the gradient space toward the point most prone to data leakage. Extensive experiments show that EGGV achieves complete attack coverage and surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) with at least a 43% increase in reconstruction quality (PSNR) and a 45% improvement in stealthiness (D-SNR).",

However, the security against spoofing attacks remains relatively understudied. For example, a piggyback attack can maliciously alter the meaning of watermarked text-transforming it into hate speech-while preserving the original watermark, thereby damaging the reputation of the LLM provider. We identify two core challenges that make defending against spoofing difficult: (1) the need for watermarks to be both sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving edits, and (2) the contradiction between the need to detect global semantic shifts and the local, auto-regressive nature of most watermarking schemes. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that post-hoc embeds watermarks into a given target text while preserving its original meaning. Our method introduces a semantic mapping model, which guides the generation of a green-red token list, contrastively trained to be sensitive to semantic-distorting changes and insensitive to semantic-preserving changes. Experiments on two standard benchmarks demonstrate strong robustness against removal attacks and security against spoofing attacks, including sentiment reversal and toxic content insertion, while maintaining high watermark detectability. Our approach offers a significant step toward more secure and semantically aware watermarking for LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/contrastive-watermark.",

As a result, there is increasing momentum toward creating databases that incorporate real-world user data to more accurately mirror business environments. However, privacy concerns deter users from directly sharing their data, underscoring the importance of creating synthesized databases for benchmarking that also prioritize privacy protection. Differential privacy (DP)-based data synthesis has become a key method for safeguarding privacy when sharing data, but the focus has largely been on minimizing errors in aggregate queries or downstream ML tasks, with less attention given to benchmarking factors like query runtime performance. This paper delves into differentially private database synthesis specifically for benchmark publishing scenarios, aiming to produce a synthetic database whose benchmarking factors closely resemble those of the original data. Introducing \\textit{PrivBench}, an innovative synthesis framework based on sum-product networks (SPNs), we support the synthesis of high-quality benchmark databases that maintain fidelity in both data distribution and query runtime performance while preserving privacy. We validate that PrivBench can ensure database-level DP even when generating multi-relation databases with complex reference relationships.
